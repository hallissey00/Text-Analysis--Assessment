       "['Premier League\\nThe Premier League (legal name: The Football Association Premier League Limited), is the top level of the men\\'s English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). Seasons typically run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing all 19 other teams both home and away).[1] Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, with occasional weekday evening fixtures.[2]\\nThe competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from the Football League, founded in 1888, and take advantage of a lucrative television rights sale to Sky.[3] From 2019 to 2020, the league\\'s accumulated television rights deals were worth around £3.1\\xa0billion a year, with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 128 and 32 games respectively.[4][5] The Premier League is a corporation where chief executive Richard Masters is responsible for its management, whilst the member clubs act as shareholders.[6] Clubs were apportioned central payment revenues of £2.4\\xa0billion in 2016–17, with a further £343\\xa0million in solidarity payments to English Football League (EFL) clubs.[7]\\nThe Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643\\xa0million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7\\xa0billion people.[8][9] For the 2018–19 season, the average Premier League match attendance was at 38,181,[10] second to the German Bundesliga\\'s 43,500,[11] while aggregated attendance across all matches is the highest of any association football league at 14,508,981.[12] Most stadium occupancies are near capacity.[13] The Premier League ranks first in the UEFA coefficients of leagues based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons as of 2021.[14] The English top-flight has produced the second-highest number of UEFA Champions League/European Cup titles, with five English clubs having won fourteen European trophies in total.[15]\\nFifty clubs have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992: forty-eight English and two Welsh clubs. Seven of them have won the title: Manchester United (13), Manchester City (6), Chelsea (5), Arsenal (3), Blackburn Rovers (1), Leicester City (1) and Liverpool (1).[16]\\nDespite significant European success in the 1970s and early 1980s, the late 1980s marked a low point for English football. Stadiums were crumbling, supporters endured poor facilities, hooliganism was rife, and English clubs had been banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985.[17] The Football League First Division, the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy\\'s Serie A and Spain\\'s La Liga in attendances and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.[18]\\nBy the turn of the 1990s, the downward trend was starting to reverse. At the 1990 FIFA World Cup, England reached the semi-finals; UEFA, European football\\'s governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990, resulting in Manchester United lifting the UEFA Cup Winners\\' Cup in 1991. The Taylor Report on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadiums in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster, was published in January 1990.[19]\\nDuring the 1980s, major English clubs had begun to transform into business ventures, applying commercial principles to club administration to maximise revenue. Martin Edwards of Manchester United, Irving Scholar of Tottenham Hotspur, and David Dein of Arsenal were among the leaders in this transformation.[20] The commercial imperative led to the top clubs seeking to increase their power and revenue: the clubs in Division One threatened to break away from the Football League, and in so doing they managed to increase their voting power and gain a more favourable financial arrangement, taking a 50% share of all television and sponsorship income in 1986.[20] They demanded that television companies should pay more for their coverage of football matches,[21] and revenue from television grew in importance. The Football League received £6.3\\xa0million for a two-year agreement in 1986, but by 1988, in a deal agreed with ITV, the price rose to £44\\xa0million over four years with the leading clubs taking 75% of the cash.[22][23] According to Scholar, who was involved in the negotiations of television deals, each of the First Division clubs received only around £25,000 per year from television rights before 1986, this increased to around £50,000 in the 1986 negotiation, then to £600,000 in 1988.[24] The 1988 negotiations were conducted under the threat of ten clubs leaving to form a \"super league\", but they were eventually persuaded to stay, with the top clubs taking the lion\\'s share of the deal.[22][25][26] The negotiations also convinced the bigger clubs that in order to receive enough votes, they needed to take the whole of First Division with them instead of a smaller \"super league\".[27] By the beginning of the 1990s, the big clubs again considered breaking away, especially now that they had to fund the cost of stadium upgrade as proposed by the Taylor Report.[28]\\nIn 1990, the managing director of London Weekend Television (LWT), Greg Dyke, met with the representatives of the \"big five\" football clubs in England (Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Everton and Arsenal) over a dinner.[29] The meeting was to pave the way for a breakaway from The Football League.[30] Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money.[31] The five clubs agreed with the suggestion and decided to press ahead with it; however, the league would have no credibility without the backing of The Football Association, and so David Dein of Arsenal held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea. The FA did not enjoy an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and considered it as a way to weaken the Football League\\'s position.[32] The FA released a report in June 1991, Blueprint for the Future of Football, that supported the plan for the Premier League with the FA as the ultimate authority that would oversee the breakaway league.[27]\\nAt the close of the 1990–1991 season, a proposal was tabled for the establishment of a new league that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991 by the game\\'s top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League.[33] The newly formed top division was to have commercial independence from The Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe.[18] Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, he and ITV (of which LWT was part) lost out in the bidding for broadcast rights: BSkyB won with a bid of £304\\xa0million over five years, with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on Match of the Day.[29][31]\\nThe First Division clubs resigned en masse from the Football League in 1992, and on 27 May that year the FA Premier League was formed as a limited company, working out of an office at the Football Association\\'s then headquarters in Lancaster Gate.[18] The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were:[34]\\nThis meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three. There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained the same as the old First and Second Divisions with three teams relegated from the league and three promoted.[26]\\nThe league held its first season in 1992–93. It was composed of 22 clubs for that season (reduced to 20 in the 1995–96 season). The first Premier League goal was scored by Brian Deane of Sheffield United in a 2–1 win against Manchester United.[35]\\nLuton Town, Notts County, and West Ham United were the three teams relegated from the old First Division at the end of the 1991–92 season, and did not take part in the inaugural Premier League season.[36]\\nThe 2000s saw the dominance of the so-called \"Top Four\" clubs. Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United[37][38] finished at the top of the table for bulk of the decade, thereby guaranteeing qualification for the UEFA Champions League. Only four other clubs managed to qualify for the competition during this period: Leeds United (2000–01), Newcastle United (2001–02 and 2002–03), Everton (2004–05) and Tottenham Hotspur (2009–10) – each occupying the final Champions League spot, with the exception of Newcastle in the 2002–03 season, who finished third.\\nFollowing the 2003–04 season, Arsenal acquired the nickname \"The Invincibles\" as it became the first, and to date, only club to complete a Premier League campaign without losing a single game.[39][40]\\nIn May 2008, Kevin Keegan stated that \"Top Four\" dominance threatened the division: \"This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world.\"[41] Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said in defence: \"There are a lot of different tussles that go on in the Premier League depending on whether you\\'re at the top, in the middle or at the bottom that make it interesting.\"[42]\\nBetween 2005 and 2012 there was a Premier League representative in seven of the eight Champions League finals, with only \"Top Four\" clubs reaching that stage. Liverpool (2005), Manchester United (2008) and Chelsea (2012) won the competition during this period, with Arsenal (2006), Liverpool (2007), Chelsea (2008) and Manchester United (2009 and 2011) all losing Champions League finals.[43] Leeds United were the only non-\"Top Four\" side to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League, in the 2000–01 season. There were three Premier League teams in the Champions League semi-finals in 2006–07, 2007–08, and 2008–09, a feat only ever achieved five times (along with Serie A in 2002–03 and La Liga in 1999–2000).\\nAdditionally, between the 1999–2000 and 2009–10 seasons, four Premier League sides reached UEFA Cup or Europa League finals, with only Liverpool managing to win the competition in 2001. Arsenal (2000), Middlesbrough (2006) and Fulham (2010) all lost their finals.[44]\\nAlthough the group\\'s dominance was reduced to a degree after this period with the emergence of Manchester City and Tottenham, in terms of all time Premier League points won they remain clear by some margin. As of the end of the 2018–19 season – the 27th season of the Premier League – Liverpool, in fourth place in the all-time points table, were over 250 points ahead of the next team, Tottenham Hotspur. They are also the only teams to maintain a winning average of over 50% throughout their entire Premier League tenures.[45]\\nThe years following 2009 marked a shift in the structure of the \"Top Four\" with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City both breaking into the top four places on a regular basis, turning the \"Top Four\" into the \"Big Six\".[46] In the 2009–10 season, Tottenham finished fourth and became the first team to break the top four since Everton five years prior.[47] Criticism of the gap between an elite group of \"super clubs\" and the majority of the Premier League has continued, nevertheless, due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier League clubs.[48] Manchester City won the title in the 2011–12 season, becoming the first club outside the \"Big Four\" to win since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–95 season. That season also saw two of the \"Big Four\" (Chelsea and Liverpool) finish outside the top four places for the first time since that season.[46]\\nWith only four UEFA Champions League qualifying places available in the league, greater competition for qualification now exists, albeit from a narrow base of six clubs. In the five seasons following the 2011–12 campaign, Manchester United and Liverpool both found themselves outside of the top four three times, while Chelsea finished 10th in the 2015–16 season. Arsenal finished 5th in 2016–17, ending their record run of 20 consecutive top-four finishes.[49]\\nIn the 2015–16 season, the top four was breached by a non-Big Six side for the first time since Everton in 2005. Leicester City were the surprise winners of the league, qualifying for the Champions League as a result.[50]\\nOff the pitch, the \"Big Six\" wield significant financial power and influence, with these clubs arguing that they should be entitled to a greater share of revenue due to the greater stature of their clubs globally and the attractive football they aim to play.[51] Objectors argue that the egalitarian revenue structure in the Premier League helps to maintain a competitive league which is vital for its future success.[52] The 2016–17 Deloitte Football Money League report showed the financial disparity between the \"Big Six\" and the rest of the division. All of the \"Big Six\" had revenues greater than €350\\xa0million, with Manchester United having the largest revenue in the league at €676.3\\xa0million. Leicester City was the closest club to the \"Big Six\" in terms of revenue, recording a figure of €271.1\\xa0million for that season – helped by participation in the Champions League. The eighth-largest revenue generator, West Ham – who did not play in European competition – had revenues of €213.3\\xa0million, nearly half of those of the club with the fifth-largest revenue, Liverpool (€424.2\\xa0million).[53] A substantial part of the clubs\\' revenue by then came from television broadcast deals, with the biggest clubs each taking from around £150\\xa0million to nearly £200\\xa0million in the 2016–17 season from such deals.[54] In Deloitte\\'s 2019 report, all the \"Big Six\" were in the top ten of the world\\'s richest clubs.[55]\\nFrom the 2019–20 season, video assistant referees were used in the league.[56]\\nProject Big Picture was announced in October 2020 that described a plan to reunite the top Premier League clubs with the English Football League, proposed by leading Premier League clubs Manchester United and Liverpool.[57] It has been criticised by the Premier League leadership and the UK government\\'s Department of Culture, Media and Sport.[58]\\nOn 26 April 2021, play was stopped during a match between Leicester City and Crystal Palace to allow players Wesley Fofana and Cheikhou Kouyaté to break Ramadan fast. It is believed to be the first time in Premier League history that a game was paused to allow Muslim players to eat and drink after the sun had set in accordance with the rules of the faith.[59]\\nThe 2022–23 season will be the first to take a six-week break between November and December 2022 to allow for the first winter World Cup,[60] with a return for the Boxing Day fixtures.[61] The Premier League players decided to take the knee only at some selected “significant moments”, instead of the routine before matches. However, they assured to “remain resolutely committed to eradicate racial prejudice”.[62]\\nThe Football Association Premier League Ltd (FAPL)[63][64][65] is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs. Each club is a shareholder, with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts. The clubs elect a chairman, chief executive, and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league.[66] The Football Association is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league.[67]\\nThe current chief executive is Richard Masters, who was appointed in December 2019,[68] and the chairman is Gary Hoffman, appointed in April 2020.[69] Both men succeeded Richard Scudamore, who held the combined position of \"Executive Chairman\" from November 1999 until his retirement in November 2019.[69]\\nThe Premier League sends representatives to UEFA\\'s European Club Association, the number of clubs and the clubs themselves chosen according to UEFA coefficients. For the 2012–13 season the Premier League has 10 representatives in the Association: Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Everton, Fulham, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur.[70] The European Club Association is responsible for electing three members to UEFA\\'s Club Competitions Committee, which is involved in the operations of UEFA competitions such as the Champions League and UEFA Europa League.[71]\\nThe Premier League has faced criticism of its governance due to an alleged lack of transparency and accountability.\\nFollowing the Premier League\\'s blocking of the attempted takeover of Newcastle United by a PIF-backed consortium through the league\\'s Owners\\' and Directors\\' test, many MPs, Newcastle United fans and related parties to the deal denounced the Premier League for its perceived lack of transparency and accountability throughout the process.[72][73][74] On 6 July 2021, consortium member Amanda Staveley of PCP Capital Partners said that \"fans surely deserve absolute transparency from the regulators across all their processes – to best ensure that they act responsibly. They (the Premier League) are performing a function like that of a government regulator – but without the same systems for accountability.\"[74]\\nOn 22 July 2021, Tracey Crouch MP – chair of the fan-led review into the UK\\'s football governance – announced in the review\\'s interim findings that the Premier League had \"lost the trust and confidence\" of fans. The review also recommended that a new independent regulator be created to oversee matters such as club takeovers.[75][76]\\nPremier League chief executive Richard Masters had earlier spoken out against the implementation of an independent regulator, saying in May 2021, \"I don’t think that the independent regulator is the answer to the question. I would defend the Premier League\\'s role as regulator of its clubs over the past 30 years.\"[77]\\n[The Premier League] is very tough and is different. If you compare this league to another league, it\\'s like playing another sport.\\nAntonio Conte, on the competitiveness of the Premier League.[78]\\nIn [The Premier League] you never really know what is going to happen, there is very little between the teams.\\nLuis Suarez[79]\\nThere are 20 clubs in the Premier League. During the course of a season (from August to May) each club plays the others twice (a double round-robin system), once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for 38 games. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, the head-to-head record between the tied teams is taken into consideration (points scored in the matches between the teams, followed by away goals in those matches.) If two teams are still tied, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank.[80]\\nA system of promotion and relegation exists between the Premier League and the EFL Championship. The three lowest placed teams in the Premier League are relegated to the Championship, and the top two teams from the Championship promoted to the Premier League,[81] with an additional team promoted after a series of play-offs involving the third, fourth, fifth and sixth placed clubs.[82] The number of clubs was reduced from 22 to 20 in 1995, when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted.[83][84] The top flight had only been expanded to 22 teams at the start of the 1991–92 season – the year prior to the formation of the Premier League.[84]\\nOn 8 June 2006, FIFA requested that all major European leagues, including Italy\\'s Serie A and Spain\\'s La Liga, be reduced to 18 teams by the start of the 2007–08 season. The Premier League responded by announcing their intention to resist such a reduction.[85] Ultimately, the 2007–08 season kicked off again with 20 teams.[86]\\nFifty clubs have played in the Premier League from its inception in 1992, up to and including the 2022–23 season.[87]\\nNotably one-time champions Blackburn Rovers are currently out of the Premier League.\\nTwenty clubs will compete in the 2022–23 Premier League, with three promoted from the Championship:\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 2011, after Swansea City gained promotion, a Welsh club participated in the Premier League for the first time.[89][90] The first Premier League match to be played outside England was Swansea City\\'s home match at the Liberty Stadium against Wigan Athletic on 20 August 2011.[91] The number of Welsh clubs in the Premier League increased to two in 2013–14, as Cardiff City gained promotion,[92] but they were relegated after their maiden season.[93] Cardiff were promoted again in 2017–18 but the number of Welsh clubs remained the same for the 2018–19 Premier League season, as Swansea City had been relegated from the Premier League in 2017–18.[94] Following Cardiff City\\'s relegation after the 2018–19 season, there are currently no Welsh clubs participating in the Premier League.[95]\\nBecause they are members of the Football Association of Wales (FAW), the question of whether clubs like Swansea should represent England or Wales in European competitions has caused long-running discussions in UEFA. Swansea took one of England\\'s three available places in the Europa League in 2013–14 by winning the League Cup in 2012–13.[96] The right of Welsh clubs to take up such English places was in doubt until UEFA clarified the matter in March 2012, allowing them to participate.[97]\\nParticipation in the Premier League by some Scottish or Irish clubs has sometimes been discussed, but without result. The idea came closest to reality in 1998, when Wimbledon received Premier League approval to relocate to Dublin, Ireland, but the move was blocked by the Football Association of Ireland.[98][99][100][101] Additionally, the media occasionally discusses the idea that Scotland\\'s two biggest teams, Celtic and Rangers, should or will take part in the Premier League, but nothing has come of these discussions.[102]\\nThe top four teams in the Premier League qualify automatically for the subsequent season\\'s UEFA Champions League group stage. The winners of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League may earn an additional qualification for the subsequent season\\'s UEFA Champions League group stage if they are not in the top four. If this means six Premier League teams qualify, then the fourth-placed team in the Premier League instead plays in the UEFA Europa League, for any single nation is limited to a maximum of five teams in UCL.\\nThe fifth-placed team in the Premier League, as well as the winner of the FA Cup, qualifies for the subsequent season\\'s UEFA Europa League group stage, but if the winner also finished in the top five places in the Premier League or has won one of UEFA\\'s major tournaments, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth. The winner of the EFL Cup qualifies for the subsequent season\\'s UEFA Europa League second qualifying round, but if the winner already qualified for a UEFA competition via their performance in another competition, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth in the Premier League, or seventh if the FA Cup result already caused the sixth-placed team to qualify.[103]\\nThe number of places allocated to English clubs in UEFA competitions is dependent upon the position a country holds in the UEFA country coefficients, which are calculated based upon the performance of teams in UEFA competitions in the previous five years. Currently the ranking of England (and de facto the Premier League) is second, behind Spain.\\nAn exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.[105] UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. At that time, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League.[106] This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea – who had won the Champions League that summer, but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa League.[107]\\nFrom 2015–16, the Europa League winners qualify for the Champions League, increasing the maximum number of participants per country to five.[108] This took effect in England in 2016–17, when Manchester United finished sixth in the Premier League and won the Europa League, giving England five Champions League entrants for 2017–18.[109] In these instances, any Europa League berth vacated will not be handed down to the next-best Premier League finisher outside a qualifying place and so the association\\'s Europa League entrants for the following season will be reduced. If it happens that both Champions League and Europa League winners are of the same association and both finish outside the top four, then the fourth-placed team will be transferred to the Europa League.\\nBetween the 1992–93 and the 2021–22 seasons, Premier League clubs won the UEFA Champions League six times (and had eight runners-up), behind Spain\\'s La Liga with twelve wins, and ahead of, among others, Italy\\'s Serie A with five wins and Germany\\'s Bundesliga with four wins.[43] The FIFA Club World Cup (originally called the FIFA Club World Championship) has been won three times by a Premier League club (Manchester United in 2008, Liverpool in 2019, and Chelsea in 2021),[110] with two runners-up (Liverpool in 2005 and Chelsea in 2012),[111][112] behind Spain\\'s La Liga with seven wins[113] and Brazil\\'s Brasileirão with four wins.[111][112][114][115]\\nThe league changed its name from the FA Premier League to simply the Premier League in 2007.[116] From 1993 to 2016, the Premier League had title sponsorship rights sold to two companies, which were Carling brewery and Barclays Bank PLC; Barclays was the most recent title sponsor, having sponsored the Premier League from 2001 until 2016 (until 2004, the title sponsorship was held through its Barclaycard brand before shifting to its main banking brand in 2004).[117]\\nBarclays\\' deal with the Premier League expired at the end of the 2015–16 season. The FA announced on 4 June 2015 that it would not pursue any further title sponsorship deals for the Premier League, arguing that they wanted to build a \"clean\" brand for the competition more in line with those of major U.S. sports leagues.[119]\\nAs well as sponsorship for the league itself, the Premier League has a number of official partners and suppliers.[120] The official ball supplier for the league is Nike who have had the contract since the 2000–01 season when they took over from Mitre.[121] Under its Merlin brand, Topps held the licence to produce collectables for the Premier League between 1994 and 2019 including stickers (for their sticker album) and trading cards.[122] Launched in the 2007–08 season, Topps’ Match Attax, the official Premier League trading card game, is the best selling boys collectable in the UK, and is also the biggest selling sports trading card game in the world.[122][123] In October 2018, Panini were awarded the licence to produce collectables from the 2019–20 season.[124] The chocolate company Cadbury has been the official snack partner of the Premier League since 2017, and sponsored the Golden Boot, Golden Glove and Playmaker of the Season awards from the 2017–18 season to 2019–20 season.[125][126] The Coca-Cola Company (under its Coca-Cola Zero Sugar product line) sponsored these awards during the 2020–21 season with Castrol being the current sponsor as of the 2021–22 season.\\nThe Premier League has the highest revenue of any association football league in the world, with total club revenues of €2.48\\xa0billion in 2009–10.[127][128] In 2013–14, due to improved television revenues and cost controls, the Premier League clubs collectively made a net profit in excess of £78\\xa0million, exceeding all other football leagues.[129] In 2010 the Premier League was awarded the Queen\\'s Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to English football and the United Kingdom\\'s broadcasting industry.[130]\\nThe Premier League includes some of the richest football clubs in the world. Deloitte\\'s \"Football Money League\" listed seven Premier League clubs in the top 20 for the 2009–10 season,[131] and all 20 clubs were in the top 40 globally by the end of the 2013–14 season, largely as a result of increased broadcasting revenue.[132] In 2019, the league generated around £3.1\\xa0billion per year in domestic and international television rights.[4]\\nPremier League clubs agreed in principle in December 2012, to radical new cost controls. The two proposals consist of a break-even rule and a cap on the amount clubs can increase their wage bill by each season. With the new television deals on the horizon, momentum has been growing to find ways of preventing the majority of the cash going straight to players and agents.[133]\\nCentral payments for the 2016–17 season amounted to £2,398,515,773 across the 20 clubs, with each team receiving a flat participation fee of £35,301,989 and additional payments for TV broadcasts (£1,016,690 for general UK rights to match highlights, £1,136,083 for each live UK broadcast of their games and £39,090,596 for all overseas rights), commercial rights (a flat fee of £4,759,404) and a notional measure of \"merit\" which was based upon final league position.[7] The merit component was a nominal sum of £1,941,609 multiplied by each finishing place, counted from the foot of the table (e.g., Burnley finished 16th in May 2017, five places counting upwards, and received 5 × £1,941,609 = £9,708,045 merit payment).[7]\\nSince its split with the Football League, established clubs in the Premier League have a funding disparity from counterparts in lower leagues. Revenue from television rights between the leagues has played a part in this.[134]\\nPromoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first Premier League season. One Premier League newcomer has been relegated back to the Football League every season, save the 2001–02, 2011–12 and 2017–18 seasons. In the 1997–98 season, all three promoted clubs were relegated by the season\\'s end.[135]\\nThe Premier League distributes a portion of its television revenue as \"parachute payments\" to relegated clubs for adjustment to television revenue loss. The average Premier League team receives £41\\xa0million[136] while the average Championship club receives £2\\xa0million.[137] Starting with the 2013–14 season, these payments are in excess of £60\\xa0million over four seasons.[138] Critics maintain that the payments widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not,[139] leading to the common occurrence of teams \"bouncing back\" soon after their relegation.\\nClubs which have failed to win immediate promotion back to the Premier League have seen financial problems, in some cases administration or liquidation. Further relegations down the footballing ladder have occurred for multiple clubs unable to cope with the gap.[140][141]\\nTelevision has played a major role in the history of the Premier League. The League\\'s decision to assign broadcasting rights to BSkyB in 1992 was at the time a radical decision, but one that has paid off. At the time pay television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market, as was charging fans to watch live televised football. However, a combination of Sky\\'s strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public\\'s appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League\\'s TV rights soar.[23]\\nThe Premier League sells its television rights on a collective basis. This is in contrast to some other European leagues, including La Liga, in which each club sells its rights individually, leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs.[142] The money is divided into three parts:[143] half is divided equally between the clubs; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position, the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club, and equal steps all the way down the table; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television, with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this. The income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs.[144]\\nNot all Premier League matches are televised in the United Kingdom, as the league upholds the long-standing prohibition on telecasts of any association football match (domestic or otherwise) that kicks off between 2:45\\xa0p.m. and 5:15\\xa0p.m. on Saturday matchdays.[145][146][147]\\nThe first Sky television rights agreement was worth £304\\xa0million over five seasons.[148] The next contract, negotiated to start from the 1997–98 season, rose to £670\\xa0million over four seasons.[148] The third contract was a £1.024\\xa0billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001 to 2002 to 2003–04. The league brought in £320\\xa0million from the sale of its international rights for the three-year period from 2004 to 2005 to 2006–07. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis.[149] Sky\\'s monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid £1.7\\xa0billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3\\xa0pm match solely for Irish viewers. The BBC has retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on Match of the Day) for £171.6\\xa0million, a 63\\xa0per\\xa0cent increase on the £105\\xa0million it paid for the previous three-year period.[150] Sky and BT have agreed to jointly pay £84.3\\xa0million for delayed television rights to 242 games (that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10\\xa0pm on matchday.[151] Overseas television rights fetched £625\\xa0million, nearly double the previous contract.[152] The total raised from these deals is more than £2.7\\xa0billion, giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around £40\\xa0million-a-year from 2007 to 2010.[153]\\nThe TV rights agreement between the Premier League and Sky has faced accusations of being a cartel, and a number of court cases have arisen as a result.[154] An investigation by the Office of Fair Trading in 2002 found BSkyB to be dominant within the pay TV sports market, but concluded that there were insufficient grounds for the claim that BSkyB had abused its dominant position.[155] In July 1999 the Premier League\\'s method of selling rights collectively for all member clubs was investigated by the UK Restrictive Practices Court, which concluded that the agreement was not contrary to the public interest.[156]\\nThe BBC\\'s highlights package on Saturday and Sunday nights, as well as other evenings when fixtures justify, will run until 2016.[157] Television rights alone for the period 2010 to 2013 have been purchased for £1.782\\xa0billion.[158] On 22 June 2009, due to troubles encountered by Setanta Sports after it failed to meet a final deadline over a £30\\xa0million payment to the Premier League, ESPN was awarded two packages of UK rights containing 46 matches that were available for the 2009–10 season as well as a package of 23 matches per season from 2010 to 2011 to 2012–13.[159] On 13 June 2012, the Premier League announced that BT had been awarded 38 games a season for the 2013–14, 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons at £246\\xa0million-a-year. The remaining 116 games were retained by Sky, which paid £760\\xa0million-a-year. The total domestic rights have raised £3.018\\xa0billion, an increase of 70.2% over the 2010–11 to 2012–13 rights.[160] The value of the licensing deal rose by another 70.2% in 2015, when Sky and BT paid £5.136\\xa0billion to renew their contracts with the Premier League for another three years up to the 2018–19 season.[161]\\nA new rights cycle began in the 2019–20 season, with the domestic package increasing to 200 matches overall; in February 2018, BT were awarded the package of 32 lunchtime fixtures on Saturdays, while Sky was awarded four of the seven packages, covering the majority of weekend fixtures (including eight new prime time fixtures on Saturdays), as well as Monday and Friday matches. Two remaining packages of 20 fixtures each were to be sold at a later date, including three rounds of mid-week fixtures and a bank holiday round. As Sky already owned the maximum number of matches it could hold without breaching a 148-match cap, it was speculated that at least one of the new packages could go to a new entrant, such as a streaming service. The five packages sold to BT and Sky were valued at £4.464\\xa0billion.[162] In June 2018, it was announced that Amazon Prime Video and BT had acquired the remaining two packages; Amazon acquired rights to 20 matches per-season, covering a mid-week round in December, and all Boxing Day fixtures.[163] The Amazon telecasts are produced in association with Sunset + Vine and BT Sport.[164]\\nWith the resumption of play in the 2019–20 Premier League due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the Premier League announced that all remaining matches would be carried on British television, split primarily across Sky, BT, and Amazon. A large number of these matches were also scheduled for free-to-air broadcasts, with Sky airing 25 on Pick, Amazon streaming its four matches on Twitch, and the BBC – for the first time in league history – carrying four live matches.[165][166][167][168]\\nAs matches would continue to be played without spectators upon the start of the 2020–21 Premier League, its clubs voted on 8 September to continue broadcasting all matches through at least September (with the BBC and Amazon each holding one additional match), and \"appropriate arrangements\" being made for October.[169][170] It was later announced that matches not selected for broadcast would be carried on pay-per-view via BT Sport Box Office and Sky Box Office at a cost of £14.95 per-match. The PPV scheme was poorly received; the Football Supporters\\' Federation felt that the price was too high, and there were concerns that it could encourage piracy. There were calls from supporters to boycott the pay-per-views, and make donations to support charitable causes instead (with Newcastle\\'s \"Charity Not PPV\" campaign raising £20,000 for a local food bank, and Arsenal fans raising £34,000 for Islington Giving). On 13 November, amid the reintroduction of measures across the UK, the Premier League officially announced that the non-televised matches would be assigned to its main broadcast partners, and again including additional matches for the BBC and Amazon.[171][172][173][174]\\nUK highlights\\nIn August 2016, it was announced the BBC would be creating a new magazine-style show for the Premier League entitled The Premier League Show.[175]\\nThe Premier League is the most-watched football league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643\\xa0million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7\\xa0billion people,.[8] The Premier League\\'s production arm, Premier League Productions, is operated by IMG Productions and produces content for its international television partners.[176]\\nThe Premier League is the most widely distributed sports programme in Asia.[177] In Australia, Optus telecommunications holds exclusive rights to the Premier League, providing live broadcasts and online access (Fox Sports formerly held rights).[178] In India, the matches are broadcast live on STAR Sports. In China, the broadcast rights were awarded to Super Sports in a six-year agreement that began in the 2013–14 season.[179] As of the 2019–20 season, Canadian broadcast rights to the Premier League are owned by DAZN, after having been jointly owned by Sportsnet and TSN from 2013 to 2014.[180]\\nThe Premier League is broadcast in the United States by NBC Sports, a division of Sky parent Comcast.[181] Acquiring the rights to the Premier League in 2013 (replacing Fox Soccer and ESPN), NBC Sports has been widely praised for its coverage.[182][183][184] NBC Sports reached a six-year extension with the Premier League in 2015 to broadcast the league until the end of the 2021–22 season in a deal valued at $1\\xa0billion (£640\\xa0million).[185][186] In November 2021, NBC reached another six-year extension through 2028 in a deal valued at $2.76\\xa0billion (£2\\xa0billion).[187][188]\\nThe Premier League is broadcast by SuperSport across sub-Saharan Africa.[189] Broadcasters to continental Europe until 2025 include Canal+ for France,[190] Sky Sport for Germany and Austria,[191] Match TV for Russia,[192] Sky Sport for Italy,[193] Eleven Sports for Portugal,[194] DAZN for Spain,[195] beIN Sports to Turkey,[196] Digi Sport for Romania [197] and NENT to Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark and Norway),[198] Poland and the Netherlands.[199] In South America, ESPN covers much of the continent,[200] with coverage in Brazil shared between ESPN Brasil and Fox Sports.[201][202] SKY México broadcasts the league in Central America.[203]\\nAs of the 2017–18 season, Premier League football has been played in 58 stadiums since the formation of the division.[204] The Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent Taylor Report saw a recommendation that standing terraces should be abolished. As a result, all stadiums in the Premier League are all-seater.[205][206] Since the formation of the Premier League, football grounds in England have seen constant improvements to capacity and facilities, with some clubs moving to new-build stadiums.[207] Nine stadiums that have seen Premier League football have now been demolished. The stadiums for the 2017–18 season show a large disparity in capacity. For example, Wembley Stadium, the temporary home of Tottenham Hotspur, has a capacity of 90,000 while Dean Court, the home of AFC Bournemouth, has a capacity of 11,360.[208][209] The combined total capacity of the Premier League in the 2017–18 season is 806,033 with an average capacity of 40,302.[208]\\nStadium attendances are a significant source of regular income for Premier League clubs.[210] For the 2016–17 season, average attendances across the league clubs were 35,838 for Premier League matches with an aggregate attendance of 13,618,596.[211] This represents an increase of 14,712 from the average attendance of 21,126 recorded in the Premier League\\'s first season (1992–93).[212] However, during the 1992–93 season, the capacities of most stadiums were reduced as clubs replaced terraces with seats in order to meet the Taylor Report\\'s 1994–95 deadline for all-seater stadiums.[213][214] The Premier League\\'s record average attendance of 36,144 was set during the 2007–08 season.[215] This record was then beaten in the 2013–14 season recording an average attendance of 36,695 with an attendance of just under 14\\xa0million, the highest average in England\\'s top flight since 1950.[216]\\nI have never known this level before. Of course, there are managers in Germany, Italy, and Spain, but in the Premier League, these are the best managers, the elite managers. The quality, the preparation. The level is so high.\\nPep Guardiola, on the quality of managers of Premier League teams.[217]\\nManagers in the Premier League are involved in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection and player acquisition. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans.[218] Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available, and follows the completion of the UEFA \\'B\\' and \\'A\\' Licences.[219] The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis (i.e., more than 12 weeks, the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control).[220] Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment. Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker, including Paul Hart at Portsmouth , David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur  and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Manchester United.\\nArsène Wenger is the longest-serving manager, having been in charge of Arsenal in the Premier League from 1996 to his departure at the conclusion of the 2017–18 season, and holds the record for most matches managed in the Premier League with 828, all with Arsenal. He broke the record set by Alex Ferguson, who had managed 810 matches with Manchester United from the Premier League\\'s inception to his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season. Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League.[221]\\nThere have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Professor Sue Bridgewater of the University of Liverpool and Dr. Bas ter Weel of the University of Amsterdam, performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater\\'s study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match.[222]\\nPlayer transfers may only take place within transfer windows set by the Football Association. The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January. Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis.[224] As of the 2010–11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances.[225][226] This was to enable the \"home grown\" rule to be enacted, whereby the Premier League would also from 2010 require at least eight members of the named 25-man squad to be \"home-grown players\".[225]\\nAt the inception of the Premier League in 1992–93, just 11 players named in the starting line-ups for the first round of matches hailed from outside of the United Kingdom or Ireland.[227] By 2000–01, the number of foreign players participating in the Premier League was 36% of the total. In the 2004–05 season, the figure had increased to 45%. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became the first Premier League side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up,[228] and on 14 February 2005, Arsenal were the first to name a completely foreign 16-man squad for a match.[229] By 2009, under 40% of the players in the Premier League were English.[230] By February 2020, 117 different nationalities had played in the Premier League, and 101 nationalities had scored in the competition.[231]\\nIn 1999, in response to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young English players in favour of foreign players, the Home Office tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the European Union.[232] A non-EU player applying for the permit must have played for his country in at least 75\\xa0per\\xa0cent of its competitive \\'A\\' team matches for which he was available for selection during the previous two years, and his country must have averaged at least 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings over the previous two years. If a player does not meet those criteria, the club wishing to sign him may appeal.[233]\\nFollowing the implementation of Brexit in January 2021, new regulations were introduced which require all foreign players to obtain a Governing Body Endorsement (GBE) in order to play football in the United Kingdom, regardless of EU status.[234]\\n43% of players in the Premier League in 2021 were Black, as were 34% of players across the next three divisions that make up the top 92 clubs in the English football.[235]\\nA 2022 report found that 43 per cent of Premier League players are Black.[236]\\nItalics denotes players still playing professional football,Bold denotes players still playing in the Premier League.\\nThe Premier League Golden Boot is awarded each season to the top scorer in the division. Former Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer holds the record for most Premier League goals with 260.[238] Thirty-three players have reached the 100-goal mark.[239] Since the first Premier League season in 1992–93, 23 players from 11 clubs have won or shared the top scorer title.[240] Thierry Henry won his fourth overall scoring title by scoring 27 goals in the 2005–06 season. Andrew Cole and Alan Shearer hold the record for most goals in a season (34) – for Newcastle and Blackburn respectively.[241] Ryan Giggs of Manchester United holds the record for scoring goals in consecutive seasons, having scored in the first 21 seasons of the league.[242] Giggs also holds the record for the most Premier League assists, with 162.[243]\\nThere is no team or individual salary cap in the Premier League. As a result of the increasingly lucrative television deals, player wages rose sharply following the formation of the Premier League, when the average player wage was £75,000 per year.[244] In the 2018–19 season the average annual salary stood at £2.99\\xa0million.\\nThe total salary bill for the 20 Premier League clubs in the 2018–19 season was £1.62\\xa0billion; this compares to £1.05\\xa0billion in La Liga, £0.83\\xa0billion in Serie A, £0.72\\xa0billion in Bundesliga, and £0.54\\xa0billion in Ligue 1. The club with the highest average wage is Manchester United at £6.5\\xa0million. This is smaller than the club with the highest wage bill in Spain (Barcelona £10.5\\xa0million) and Italy (Juventus £6.7\\xa0million), but higher than in Germany (Bayern Munich £6.4\\xa0million) and France (Paris Saint-Germain £6.1\\xa0million). For the 2018–19 season, the ratio of the wages of the highest-paid team to lowest-paid in the Premier League is 6.82 to 1. This is much lower than in La Liga (19.1 to 1), Serie A (16 to 1), Bundesliga (20.5 to 1), and Ligue 1 (26.6 to 1). Because of the lower differential between team wage bills in the Premier League, it is often regarded as being more competitive than other top European leagues.[245]\\nThe record transfer fee for a Premier League player has risen steadily over the lifetime of the competition. Before the start of the first Premier League season, Alan Shearer became the first British player to command a transfer fee of more than £3\\xa0million.[246] The record has increased steadily and Philippe Coutinho is now the most expensive transfer involving a Premier League club at £106\\xa0million. The highest transfer fee paid by a Premier League club is £100\\xa0million for Jack Grealish.\\nThe Premier League maintains two trophies – the genuine trophy (held by the reigning champions) and a spare replica. Two trophies are held for the purpose of making the award within minutes of the title being secured, in the event that on the final day of the season two clubs are still within reach of winning the League.[272] In the rare event that more than two clubs are vying for the title on the final day of the season, a replica won by a previous club is used.[273]\\nThe current Premier League trophy was created by Royal Jewellers Garrard & Co/Asprey of London and was designed in house at Garrard & Co by Trevor Brown and Paul Marsden. It consists of a trophy with a golden crown and a malachite plinth base. The plinth weighs 33 pounds (15\\xa0kg) and the trophy weighs 22 pounds (10.0\\xa0kg).[274] The trophy and plinth are 76\\xa0cm (30\\xa0in) tall, 43\\xa0cm (17\\xa0in) wide and 25\\xa0cm (9.8\\xa0in) deep.[275]\\nIts main body is solid sterling silver and silver gilt, while its plinth is made of malachite, a semi-precious stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which the names of the title-winning clubs are listed. The green of the malachite represents the green field of play.[275] The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles on either side of the trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season.[276] The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year. In 2004, a special gold version of the trophy was commissioned to commemorate Arsenal winning the title without a single defeat.[277]\\nIn addition to the winner\\'s trophy and the individual winner\\'s medals awarded to players who win the title, the Premier League also issues other awards throughout the season.\\nA man-of-the-match award is awarded to the player who has the greatest impact in an individual match.\\nMonthly awards are also given for the Manager of the Month, Player of the Month and Goal of the Month.[278] These are also issued annually for Manager of the Season,[279] Player of the Season.[280] and Goal of the Season. The Young Player of the Season award is given to the most outstanding U-23 player starting from the 2019–20 season.[281]\\nThe Golden Boot award is given to the top goalscorer of every season, the Playmaker of the Season award is given to the player who makes the most assists of every season,[282] and the Golden Glove award is given to the goalkeeper with the most clean sheets at the end of the season.[283]\\nFrom the 2017–18 season, players also receive a milestone award for 100 appearances and every century there after and also players who score 50 goals and multiples thereof. Each player to reach these milestones is to receive a presentation box from the Premier League containing a special medallion and a plaque commemorating their achievement.[284]\\nIn 2012, the Premier League celebrated its second decade by holding the 20 Seasons Awards:[285]\\nBibliography\\n',\n",
       " '1992–93 FA Premier League\\nThe 1992–93 FA Premier League was the inaugural season of the Premier League, the top division of English football. The season began on 15 August 1992 and ended on 11 May 1993. The league was made up of the 22 clubs that broke away from The Football League at the end of the 1991–92 season. The new league was backed up by a five-year, £305\\xa0million deal with Sky to televise Premier League matches. In concept, the Premier League was identical to the old First Division of the Football League, which was now reduced to three divisions.\\nIn May 1992–93, the breakaway league signed a broadcasting rights contract with Sky and the BBC valued at £304\\xa0million, the largest such agreement in the history of British sport.[2] The league\\'s executive committee was unable, however, to secure title sponsorship for the new competition after eight clubs blocked a proposed £13\\xa0million deal with brewers Bass.[3] Nonetheless, clubs began to utilise their dramatically increased wealth to fund a series of high-profile transfers.[4]\\nAlthough the idea of a super league had been mentioned by football\\'s governing bodies and evaluated by the media since the mid 1980s, plans for a new Premier League of 22 clubs were first unveiled by the Football Association in October 1990, and included in the Football Association\\'s Blueprint for the Future of Football, published in June 1991.[5] The majority of First Division clubs, particularly long-established top clubs including Arsenal and Manchester United, were in favour of a breakaway from the Football League, although Football League president Bill Fox criticised the planned Premier League as an attempt by the Football Association to \"hijack\" the First Division. \\nShortly before the season began, newly promoted Blackburn Rovers signed Southampton\\'s 21-year-old England international striker Alan Shearer for a new British record fee variously reported as £3.3\\xa0million,[6] £3.4\\xa0million,[7] or £3.6\\xa0million.[8] Several other players moved for fees of £2\\xa0million or more, including Arsenal\\'s David Rocastle, who joined Leeds United,[9] Dean Saunders, who moved from Liverpool to Aston Villa,[10] and Teddy Sheringham, who left Nottingham Forest for Tottenham Hotspur.[11]\\nThe structure of the new league was identical to that of the previous season\\'s Football League First Division, comprising 22 teams, with each playing the other 21 twice for a total of 42 matches. Ipswich Town and Middlesbrough had been promoted from the old Second Division as champions and runners-up respectively, and Blackburn Rovers took the third promotion place after winning the 1991–92 Second Division playoff.[12]\\nThe first Premier League title went to Manchester United, the club\\'s first title for 26 years. Their title was achieved with a 10-point lead over runners-up Aston Villa. Norwich City led the table for much of the season, but their challenge faded in the final weeks of the season and were out of contention three games before the season was over after they lost 3–1 to Ipswich Town. Norwich did however finish in third place, achieving European qualification in Mike Walker\\'s debut season as manager; with a goal difference of −4, this is the highest Premier League finish by a team with a negative goal difference. Blackburn, in the top division for the first time in almost 30 years, finished in fourth place. They briefly led the league early in the season, but suffered a shortage of goals after Alan Shearer, who had scored 16 times before the turn of the year, suffered a torn cruciate ligament and missed the second half of the season. The title race was largely between the clubs who finished in the top four after early challenges from the likes of Arsenal, Coventry City, and Queens Park Rangers were not sustained.\\nNottingham Forest\\'s league form had suffered through the sale of key players like Des Walker and Teddy Sheringham, and they were bottom of the Premier League for much of the 1992–93 season. Their relegation was confirmed in early May when they lost to Sheffield United, and manager Brian Clough announced his retirement after 18 years as manager, which had yielded one league title, two European Cups and four League Cups. Next to go were newly promoted Middlesbrough, who fell from mid-table at Christmas to go down in second from bottom place. Last to go down were Crystal Palace, who failed to win their final game of the season which would have instead consigned Oldham Athletic to the final relegation place - Oldham\\'s survival was secured with a thrilling 4–3 win over Southampton.[13]\\nTitle holders Leeds United finished 17th, which was the lowest finish from a defending league champion since Ipswich Town finished 17th in 1962–63 after having won the title in 1961–62, and the lowest any top tier champions have so far finished in the Premier League. Leeds failed to win an away game in the league. The lowest a defending champion has finished since then has been 12th (Leicester City in 2016–17, having won the title in 2015–16).[14]\\nThe top scorer in the new Premier League was Teddy Sheringham, who found the net for Nottingham Forest in their opening game of the season before being sold to Tottenham Hotspur, scoring a further 21 goals for the North London side in the league. PFA Player of the Year was Paul McGrath of Aston Villa. FWA Player of the Year was Chris Waddle, who helped Sheffield Wednesday achieve runners-up spot in both of the cups after ending his three-year spell in France. PFA Young Player of the Year was Ryan Giggs, who won the award for the second year running, and also picked up a league title medal with Manchester United.\\nTwenty-two teams competed in the league\\xa0– the top nineteen teams from the First Division and the three teams promoted from the Second Division. The promoted teams were Ipswich Town, Middlesbrough and Blackburn Rovers, returning to the top flight after an absence of six, three and twenty-six years respectively. They replaced Luton Town, Notts County and West Ham United, ending Luton Town\\'s ten-year spell in the top flight, whilst both Notts County and West Ham United were relegated after only one year in the top flight.\\n(as of 9 May 1993)\\nThe top goalscorer in the Premier League\\'s inaugural season was Teddy Sheringham, who scored one goal for Nottingham Forest before his early-season transfer followed by 21 for Tottenham Hotspur for a total of 22.[15] Alan Shearer had scored 16 goals by Christmas before suffering a season-ending injury.\\nThe Professional Footballers\\' Association (PFA) presented its annual Players\\' Player of the Year award to Paul McGrath, a veteran central defender who contributed to Aston Villa\\'s second-place finish in the Premier League. Manchester United\\'s Paul Ince came second and Blackburn\\'s Alan Shearer third.[32] The Young Player of the Year award was given to Ryan Giggs, the 19-year-old Manchester United left winger who had also won the award in the previous season. Giggs, who finished ahead of Tottenham\\'s Nick Barmby and Nottingham Forest\\'s Roy Keane, became the first player to win the award more than once.[32]\\nThe Football Writers\\' Association (the FWA) chose Chris Waddle as its Footballer of the Year.[33] Waddle, who made his return to English football with Sheffield Wednesday after three years in France with Olympique Marseille, became the first Wednesday player to win the award in its 45-year history. McGrath and Giggs finished in second and joint third place respectively in the writers\\' poll.[34]\\nThe PFA also selected eleven players to form its Team of the Year. The team included four Manchester United players (Giggs, Ince, Peter Schmeichel and Gary Pallister) and two from Leeds United (Tony Dorigo and Gary Speed). The other members of the team were McGrath, Keane, Shearer, David Bardsley (Queens Park Rangers) and Ian Wright (Arsenal).[32] The Manager of the Year award, chosen by a panel representing football\\'s governing body, the media, and fans, was given to Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson.[35] The newly formed League Managers Association also presented its own Manager of the Year award for the first time, specifically designed to recognise \"the manager who made best use of the resources available to him\". This award went to Dave Bassett of Sheffield United.[35]\\n',\n",
       " \"1993–94 FA Premier League\\nThe 1993–94 FA Premier League (known as the FA Carling Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the second season of the Premier League, the top division of professional football in England. Manchester United won the league by eight points over nearest challengers Blackburn Rovers, their second consecutive league title. Swindon Town finished bottom of the league in their first season of top-flight football and were relegated along with Sheffield United and Oldham Athletic. Manchester United also broke their own record of the most points in a season, set by themselves the previous season. This would be surpassed by Chelsea in the 2004–05 season.\\nFrom the start of the 1993–94 season, the FA Premier League was sponsored by Carling Breweries.\\nJust before the start of the season, Roy Keane became the most expensive footballer signed by an English football team. The 22-year-old Irish midfielder left relegated Nottingham Forest for Manchester United for a fee of £3.75\\xa0million.\\nDuring the 1993–94 season, many players were transferred between Premier League clubs for fees exceeding £1\\xa0million. They included David White (Manchester City to Leeds United), David Rocastle (Leeds United to Manchester City), Roy Wegerle (Blackburn Rovers to Coventry City) and Tim Flowers (Southampton to Blackburn Rovers). At £2.5\\xa0million, Flowers became the most expensive goalkeeper in English football.\\nManchester United led the 1993–94 Premier League for almost all of the season, eventually finishing as champions eight points ahead of runners-up Blackburn Rovers. They also won the FA Cup after beating Chelsea 4–0 in the final, thereby becoming only the fourth team to achieve this feat in the 20th century (after Tottenham in 1961, Arsenal in 1971 and Liverpool in 1986). Their lead of the Premier League stood at 11 points by the end of October and peaked at 16 points two months later, but a run of bad results in March was followed by defeat at Blackburn at the beginning of April, which meant that they now led the league merely on goal difference. A return to form then saw United seal the league title with two games still to play.\\nNorwich City, Leeds United, Newcastle United, Everton and Aston Villa were among the sides who showed promise early in the season before Manchester United established a runaway lead. Norwich reached the third round of the UEFA Cup after famously beating Bayern Munich in the second round, but their league form slumped after manager Mike Walker departed to Everton in January, and the Norfolk side finished 12th. Everton's brief lead of the league in the opening stages of the season was followed by a slump in form, and manager Howard Kendall stepped down at the beginning of December with the Toffees now in the bottom half of the table. They only narrowly avoided relegation on the final day of the season. Aston Villa finished a disappointing 10th in the league, but won the Football League Cup for the fourth time.\\nFinishing runners-up in the Premier League were Blackburn Rovers. In third place came Newcastle United, whose 22-year-old striker Andy Cole was the Premier League's leading scorer with 34 goals in 40 games, with a total of 41 goals in all competitions. In fourth place came Arsenal, who achieved success in European competition with a 1–0 win over Parma in the Cup Winners' Cup final.\\nSwindon Town managed just five league wins all season and were relegated in bottom place having conceded 100 league goals in 42 games. Oldham Athletic, who had avoided relegation on goal difference the previous season, were relegated on the final day of the season after failing to win at Norwich City. The final relegation place went to Sheffield United, who were relegated from the top flight after a 3–2 defeat at Chelsea, with the winning goal coming in injury time (a draw would have been enough to survive, and a loss would have still been enough had Everton not won their final match, 3–2 at home to Wimbledon after coming from 0–2 down).\\nTwenty-two teams competed in the league\\xa0– the top nineteen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Newcastle United, West Ham United and Swindon Town. Newcastle United and West Ham United returned to the top flight after absences of four and one year respectively, while Swindon Town played in the top flight for the first time. They replaced Crystal Palace, Middlesbrough and Nottingham Forest, ending their top flight spells of four, one and sixteen years respectively.\\n(as of 8 May 1994)\\n\",\n",
       " \"1994–95 FA Premier League\\nThe 1994–95 FA Premier League (known as the FA Carling Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the third season of the Premier League, the top division of professional football in England.\\nJust before the start of the season, the English transfer record was broken when Blackburn Rovers paid £5\\xa0million for 21-year-old Norwich City striker Chris Sutton. But that record was broken again in January when Manchester United paid £6\\xa0million for Newcastle United's Andy Cole, in a deal which also saw £1\\xa0million-rated Keith Gillespie move to Newcastle. Other significant transfers before and during the 1994–95 season included: Vinny Samways (Tottenham to Everton, £2\\xa0million), David Rocastle (Manchester City to Chelsea, £1.25\\xa0million), Jürgen Klinsmann (Monaco to Tottenham Hotspur, £2\\xa0million), John Scales (Wimbledon to Liverpool, £3\\xa0million) and Paul Kitson (Derby County to Newcastle United, £2.2\\xa0million).\\nThe title was won by Blackburn Rovers, whose last title success was in 1914, and also was Blackburn's first major trophy in 67 years (the last being 1927–28 FA Cup).[3]\\nKenny Dalglish's side secured the championship on the last day of the season despite losing 2–1 at his former club Liverpool, as Manchester United could only manage a 1–1 draw at West Ham.[4]\\t\\nThis meant that Blackburn Rovers qualified for the European Cup for the first time in their history, while Manchester United finished second earning a UEFA Cup place. A single point separated the two sides, who for more than half of the season enjoyed a wide gap in terms of point between themselves and the rest of the league, despite the likes of Nottingham Forest, Liverpool and Newcastle United briefly topping the league during the first three months of the season.\\nAlso qualifying for the UEFA Cup were Nottingham Forest (who finished third in their first season back in the Premier League), Liverpool (who finished fourth and won their fifth League Cup in the club's first full season following the appointment of Roy Evans) and fifth placed Leeds United.\\nThe number of teams in the league for the following year would be reduced to 20. This was to be achieved by increasing the number of teams facing relegation to four, and reducing the number of teams being promoted from Division 1 to two.\\nIn January 1995, Manchester United's 28-year-old French striker Eric Cantona (then holder of the PFA Players' Player of the Year award) assaulted a Crystal Palace fan who racially abused him[5] in his team's 1–1 draw at Selhurst Park. Cantona was banned from football for eight months, fined £20,000 and sentenced to 14 days in prison. The prison sentence was later reduced to 120 hours community service on appeal.\\nChelsea midfielder Dennis Wise was convicted of criminal damage and assault, relating to a fight with a taxi driver in London. He was given a three-month prison sentence but the conviction and prison sentence were quickly overturned on appeal.\\nArsenal midfielder Paul Merson admitted in November 1994 that he was an alcoholic and was also addicted to cocaine and gambling. He underwent a three-month drug rehabilitation programme before being allowed to resume his playing career.\\nCrystal Palace striker Chris Armstrong failed a drugs test in February 1995 but admitted that he had done wrong and returned to action after just four weeks undergoing rehabilitation. Armstrong was Palace's leading goalscorer in 1994–95, helping them reach the semi finals of both domestic cup competitions, but was unable to prevent them from being relegated back to the First Division just one season after winning promotion.\\nArsenal manager George Graham was sacked in February 1995 after nearly nine years in charge, when it was revealed that he had accepted an illegal payment of £425,000 from Norwegian agent Rune Hauge relating to the purchases of Norwegian and Danish players Pål Lydersen and John Jensen three years earlier. Graham was later banned from football for one year by the FA.\\nTwenty-two teams competed in the league\\xa0– the top nineteen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Crystal Palace, Nottingham Forest (both teams returning to the top flight after a season's absence) and Leicester City (returning after a top flight absence of seven years). This was also Leicester City's first season in the Premier League. They replaced Sheffield United, Oldham Athletic and Swindon Town, ending their top flight spells of four, three and one year respectively. This was the final season with 22 teams as all seasons after this one have 20 teams.\\n(as of 14 May 1995)\\n\",\n",
       " \"1995–96 FA Premier League\\nThe 1995–96 FA Premier League (known as the FA Carling Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the fourth season of the competition, since its formation in 1992. Due to the decision to reduce the number of clubs in the Premier League from 22 to 20, only two clubs were promoted instead of the usual three, Middlesbrough and Bolton Wanderers.[3]\\nManchester United won the Premier League and qualified for the UEFA Champions League, while Arsenal, Aston Villa, and Newcastle United qualified for the UEFA Cup. Liverpool also qualified for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup as runners-up of the FA Cup which was won by Manchester United.\\nLiverpool and Aston Villa emerged as possible title contenders early in the season, while Middlesbrough's early promise saw them occupy fourth place in late October, but an injury crisis saw their league form slump, and they could only manage a 12th-place finish. Most of the campaign was a two-horse race between Manchester United and Newcastle United. The two sides played on 27 December, with Newcastle 10 points ahead in the league. A 2–0 home win for Manchester United cut the gap to seven points, and two days later they beat Queens Park Rangers 2–1 to reduce the gap to just four points. But a 4–1 defeat at Tottenham on New Year's Day and a 0–0 draw with Aston Villa allowed Newcastle to establish a 12-point lead in January.\\nManchester United and Newcastle met again in early March, and a goal by Eric Cantona gave Manchester United a 1–0 away win and cut the gap to a single point. With one game left of the season, Manchester United led the Premier League by two points, having taken lead of the league halfway through March and stayed on top ever since. In case of the two clubs being tied for first place, the Premier League made preliminary preparations for a championship play-off match at Wembley.[4] For Newcastle to win their first title since 1927, they had to win against Tottenham and hope that Middlesbrough beat their Mancunian rivals. But the Premier League title went to Old Trafford as Manchester United won 3–0 and Newcastle could only manage a 1–1 draw with Tottenham.\\nDespite the arrival of Dennis Bergkamp, Arsenal never looked like serious title challengers, their best chance of success coming in the League Cup, where they reached the semi-finals, losing on away goals to Aston Villa. However, the North London side still qualified for the UEFA Cup by finishing fifth.\\nAston Villa won the Coca-Cola sponsored League Cup competition this season, beating Leeds United 3–0 at Wembley.\\nTitle holders Blackburn recorded the lowest ever finish by a Premier League title-holder by finishing 7th. This record was matched by Manchester United in 2013–14 and broken by Chelsea in 2015–16 and again by Leicester City in 2016–17.\\nSix days after clinching their third league title in four seasons, Manchester United became the first team to complete a second league championship and FA Cup double when a Cantona goal gave them a 1–0 win over Liverpool in the FA Cup final.[5]\\nThe Premier League relegation places went to Bolton, Queens Park Rangers and Manchester City. Bolton had spent a large proportion of their first Premier League season bottom of the table. Manchester City failed to beat Liverpool on the final day of the season, consigning them to the final relegation place on goal difference behind Southampton and Coventry City.\\nBlackburn Rovers, the 1994–95 Premier League champions, finished bottom of their group in the UEFA Champions League.[6] Manchester United were knocked out of the UEFA Cup in the first round, with Liverpool and Leeds United both being knocked out at the second round.[7] Everton were beaten in the second round of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.[8] The only English team still in European competition after Christmas were Nottingham Forest, who reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup.[7]\\nTwenty teams competed in the league\\xa0– the top eighteen teams from the previous season and the two teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Middlesbrough and Bolton Wanderers, returning to the top flight after two and fifteen years respectively. This was also Bolton Wanderers' first season in the Premier League. They replaced Crystal Palace, Norwich City, Leicester City and Ipswich Town, ending their top flight spells of one, nine, one and three years respectively.\\n(as of 5 May 1996)\\n\\n\",\n",
       " \"1996–97 FA Premier League\\nThe 1996–97 FA Premier League (known as the FA Carling Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the fifth season of the FA Premier League since its formation in 1992. The majority of the season was contested by the reigning champions, Manchester United, along with Newcastle United, Arsenal and Liverpool. The title was eventually won by Manchester United, after Liverpool and Newcastle's failure to win in their penultimate games of the season; at 75 points it is the lowest points total for a Premier League champion and lowest since the 3-1-0 points system was introduced in the 1981–82 season.\\nMiddlesbrough – despite spending millions of pounds on high-profile foreign players like Emerson, Fabrizio Ravanelli (who scored 31 goals in all competitions), Branco and Gianluca Festa – were relegated on the final day of the season and were on the losing side in both the FA Cup and League Cup finals. Middlesbrough finished in 19th place, but they would have been placed outside the relegation zone without a three-point deduction imposed for unilaterally postponing a December 1996 fixture at Blackburn Rovers, with the Middlesbrough board blaming the decision on the absence of 23 players ill or injured.[2][3] The club consulted the Premier League prior to calling off the fixture and were told to do 'what they thought best'. To protect the integrity of the game, and avoid fielding a team of untried teenagers including three goalkeepers, Middlesbrough called off the match. The Premier League subsequently absolved themselves of all responsibility and deducted the three points. This sanction meant Coventry City, who had been in the top division since 1967, finished in 17th place and avoided relegation. The decision was controversial and later resurfaced in 2006–07 when West Ham escaped a points deduction and subsequently avoided relegation.\\nAnother relegation place went to Nottingham Forest, who sacked manager Frank Clark in December. Stuart Pearce took over as temporary player-manager, spending three months in charge and winning the January 1997 Manager of the Month award. In March, Pearce quit as manager to be replaced by Dave Bassett, formerly of Crystal Palace. Also relegated, due to a 1–0 defeat to Wimbledon in their last game of the season, were Sunderland, who were leaving Roker Park after 99 years and relocating to the 42,000-seat Stadium of Light on the banks of the River Wear for the start of the 1997–98 season in Division One.\\nTwenty teams competed in the league\\xa0– the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Sunderland, Derby County (both teams returning to the top flight after a five-year absence) and Leicester City (immediately returning to the top flight after a season's absence). This was also both Sunderland and Derby County's first season in the Premier League. They replaced Manchester City, Queens Park Rangers and Bolton Wanderers, ending their top flight spells of seven, thirteen and one year respectively.\\n(as of 11 May 1997)\\n\",\n",
       " \"1997–98 FA Premier League\\nThe 1997–98 FA Premier League (known as the FA Carling Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the sixth season of the FA Premier League. It saw Arsenal lift their first league title since 1991[2] and, in so doing, became only the second team to win 'The Double' for the second time. \\nIt was Arsenal's first full season under French manager Arsène Wenger, who became the third manager to win the Premier League. Wenger followed in the footsteps of Alex Ferguson and Kenny Dalglish and, while both Ferguson and Dalglish were Scottish, Wenger was the first manager from outside the British Isles to win a league title in England.\\nAt the end of the 1997–98 FA Premier League season, a record total of nine English teams qualified for European competition.\\nPremiership champions Arsenal and runners-up Manchester United qualified for the Champions League, while UEFA Cup places went to Liverpool, Leeds United, Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers. Qualifying for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup were Chelsea (as defending champions) and FA Cup runners-up Newcastle United. Crystal Palace, while finishing bottom, qualified for the Intertoto Cup.[3]\\nThe gap between the Premier League and Division One of the Football League was highlighted at the end of 1997–98 when all three newly promoted teams were relegated. Crystal Palace were confined to bottom place in the final table having won just two home games all season. Barnsley's first season in the top division ended in relegation, although they did reach the FA Cup quarter finals and knock out Manchester United in the Fifth Round. Bolton Wanderers went down on goal difference, with 17th place being occupied by Everton: despite preserving top flight football there for the 45th season running, Howard Kendall quit as manager at Goodison Park after his third spell in charge.\\nAnother mark of the gap was that the three relegated teams in the previous season took the top three places in the 1997–98 Football League. Had Sunderland not lost the play-off final to Charlton Athletic on penalty shootout, the 20 teams from 1998–99 Premier League would have been exactly the same as those in the 1996–97 Premier League.\\nTwenty teams competed in the league\\xa0– the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Bolton Wanderers (returning to the top flight after a season's absence), Barnsley (playing in the top flight for the first time) and Crystal Palace (playing in the top flight again after a two-year absence). They replaced Sunderland, Middlesbrough and Nottingham Forest, who were relegated after top flight spells of one, two and three years respectively.\\nA list of personnel and kits of the clubs in the 1997–98 FA Premier League.\\n\",\n",
       " '1998–99 FA Premier League\\n\\nThe 1998–99 FA Premier League (known as the FA Carling Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the seventh season of the Premier League, the top division of English football, since its establishment in 1992. Manchester United won a unique treble of the league title, the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League. They secured their fifth league championship in seven seasons after losing just three league games all season.\\nThe season was also the 100th season of top flight football in England, not counting years lost to the two World Wars. Of the original clubs in the first Football League season, only Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Derby County and Everton were present for this season. \\nArsenal failed to retain their title, despite having the same points tally as last season 78 points, but had at one point looked as though they were on the brink of winning the title, after beating fellow rivals Tottenham Hotspur, while Manchester United had drawn against Liverpool, 2–2. However, Manchester United pushed on and took advantage of Arsenal\\'s 1–0 defeat at Leeds United in the penultimate match of the season and despite going 1–0 down against Tottenham on the final day, came back to win 2–1 and clinch the title. Should they have failed to win, Arsenal would have been crowned champions once more.\\nTo achieve their success, the Manchester United playing squad had been altered substantially during the close season. A total of more than £28\\xa0million had been spent on Dwight Yorke, Jaap Stam and Jesper Blomqvist, while several older players left the club; Gary Pallister returned to Middlesbrough after nine years for £2.5\\xa0million, while Brian McClair returned to Motherwell on a free transfer. In December, however, McClair was back in the Premier League as Brian Kidd\\'s assistant at Blackburn Rovers.\\nAt the end of 1998–99, the Premiership would have three Champions League places. Manchester United as well as runners-up Arsenal and third placed Chelsea would be playing in the following season\\'s Champions League. There would only be one automatic UEFA Cup place from the league – taken by fourth-placed Leeds United. Fifth-placed West Ham United qualified for the UEFA Cup via the Intertoto Cup after achieving their highest league finish for thirteen years as they continued to make progress under Harry Redknapp, outperforming several \"bigger\" clubs with greater resources. Also qualifying were Newcastle United via the 1998–99 FA Cup final, and Tottenham Hotspur via the League Cup.\\nBottom of the Premiership in the final table came Nottingham Forest, who suffered their third relegation in seven seasons. One notable low for Forest this season was an 8–1 drubbing at home, by Manchester United. Second from bottom came Blackburn Rovers, who just four seasons earlier had been Premiership champions. The final relegation place went to Charlton Athletic, who went down at the end of their first spell in the top flight for nine seasons. The only newly promoted club to survive was Middlesbrough, who finished in a respectable ninth place.\\nNone of the teams relegated from the Premiership the previous season regained their top division status in 1999, although First Division champions Sunderland regained their Premiership place after a two-year exile. The other two relegation places went to long-term absentees from the top division. Playoff winners Watford regained their top division place after an absence of 11 years, but runners-up Bradford had been outside of the top division for 77 years. These two promotion winners surprised the observers more than any other Division One side during 1998–99.\\nTwenty teams competed in the league\\xa0– the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Nottingham Forest, Middlesbrough (both teams sealing an immediate return to the top flight) and Charlton Athletic (playing in the top flight after an eight-year absence). This was also Charlton Athletic\\'s first season in the Premier League. They replaced Bolton Wanderers, Barnsley and Crystal Palace, with all three relegated teams immediately returning to the First Division after a mere season\\'s presence.\\n(as of 16 May 1999)\\n',\n",
       " \"1999–2000 FA Premier League\\nThe 1999–2000 FA Premier League (known as the FA Carling Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the eighth season of the FA Premier League, and Manchester United secured their sixth Premiership title. Like the previous season, they lost only three league games all season. Unlike in 1998–99 season, they won by a comfortable margin – 18 points as opposed to a single point.\\nTheir only disappointment of the season came when they lost their defence of the European Cup following a 3–2 defeat against Real Madrid in the quarter finals. Manchester United had withdrawn from the 1999–2000 FA Cup to participate in the FIFA World Club Championship at the request of the FA who wanted Manchester United to compete to support England's bid to host the World Cup. Chelsea would go on to win the last\\nFA Cup held at Wembley Stadium before its redevelopment. The League Cup final was won by Leicester City, for the second time in four seasons. In Europe, Leeds United reached the UEFA Cup semi final and Arsenal were on the losing side to Galatasaray in the UEFA Cup final.\\nOnly one newly promoted team suffered relegation: Watford, who finished in last place, and achieved a record Premiership low of just 24 points (a record since broken by Sunderland (twice) and by Derby County, Aston Villa, Huddersfield Town, Norwich City and Sheffield United), despite a decent start to their campaign which saw them beat both Liverpool (at Anfield) and Chelsea. The most successful promoted team was Sunderland, who finished seventh in the final table and spent much of the season pushing for a place in European competition. Bradford City, back in the top division for the first time since 1922, secured their Premiership survival on the last day of the season with a 1–0 win over Liverpool. The result meant that Liverpool lost out on a Champions League place, and Wimbledon were relegated after 14 years of top-division football. Second-from-bottom Sheffield Wednesday were relegated in their penultimate game of the season, having spent 15 of the previous 16 seasons in the top division. Wednesday's season included an 8–0 defeat at Newcastle. Amazingly Coventry City went all season without an away win but still managed to secure 14th place due to an impressive home record which saw them win 12 out of their 19 matches.\\nAs well as Premiership champions Manchester United and runners-up Arsenal, third placed Leeds United qualified for the 2000–01 Champions League. UEFA Cup places went to fourth placed Liverpool, F.A Cup winners Chelsea, and League Cup winners Leicester City.\\nPromoted to the Premiership for 2000–01 were First Division champions Charlton Athletic, runners-up Manchester City and playoff winners Ipswich Town. For the first time since the formation of the Premiership, all of the promoted teams had been members of the Premiership before.\\nTwenty teams competed in the league\\xa0– the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Sunderland, Bradford City and Watford, returning after absences of two, seventy-seven and eleven years respectively. This was also both Bradford City and Watford's first season in the Premier League. They replaced Charlton Athletic, Blackburn Rovers and Nottingham Forest. Charlton Athletic and Nottingham Forest were immediately relegated after a season's presence while Blackburn Rovers' seven-year top flight spell came to an end.\\n(as of 14 May 2000)\\n\",\n",
       " '2000–01 FA Premier League\\n\\nThe 2000–01 FA Premier League (known as the FA Carling Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the ninth FA Premier League season and the third season running which ended with Manchester United as champions and Arsenal as runners-up. Sir Alex Ferguson became the first manager to win three successive English league titles with the same club. Liverpool, meanwhile, managed a unique cup treble – winning the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup. They also finished third in the Premier League and qualified for the Champions League. Nike replaced Mitre as manufacturer of the official Premier League match ball, a contract that has since been extended multiple times, with the most recent renewal made in November 2018 to the end of the 2024–25 season.[2]\\nUEFA Cup places went to Leeds United, Chelsea, Ipswich Town, and Aston Villa, who qualified via the Intertoto Cup. None of the top six clubs in the Premier League had an English manager. The most successful English manager in the 2000–01 Premier League campaign was Peter Reid, whose Sunderland side finished seventh, having spent most of the season challenging for a place in Europe, and briefly occupied second place in the Premier League table.\\nDespite the success achieved by Sir Alex Ferguson and Gérard Houllier, the Manager of the Year Award went to George Burley. The Ipswich Town manager was in charge of a newly promoted side who began the season as relegation favourites and on a limited budget, guided his team to fifth place in the Premier League final table earning a total of 66 points - the highest total in Premier League history for a newly promoted side since the switch to a 20-team format—and a place in the UEFA Cup for the first time in almost 20 years. 2000–01 was perhaps the best season yet for newly promoted teams in the Premier League. Charlton Athletic finished ninth, their highest finish since the 1950s. The only newly promoted team to suffer relegation was Manchester City, who in the space of six seasons had now been relegated three times and promoted twice. Relegated in bottom place were Bradford City, whose return to the top division after almost 80 years was over after just two seasons. The next relegation place went to Coventry City, who were finally relegated after 34 successive seasons of top division football, which had brought numerous relegation battles and league finishes no higher than sixth place.\\nTwenty teams competed in the league\\xa0– the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Charlton Athletic, Manchester City and Ipswich Town, returning after a top flight absence of one, four and five years respectively. They replaced Wimbledon, Sheffield Wednesday and Watford. They were relegated after spending fourteen, nine and one year in the top flight respectively.\\n(as of 14 May 2001)\\n',\n",
       " \"2001–02 FA Premier League\\n\\nThe 2001–02 FA Premier League (known as the FA Barclaycard Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the tenth season of the competition. It began with a new sponsor, Barclaycard, and was titled the FA Barclaycard Premiership, replacing the previous sponsor, Carling. The title race turned into a battle among four sides – Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool and Newcastle United.\\nArsenal clinched the title on 8 May 2002 after a convincing win against Manchester United at Old Trafford, in the penultimate game of the season. This new attacking Arsenal side had won the FA Cup five days before and made history by accomplishing their third double, their second under the reign of Arsène Wenger, who showed his commitment by signing a new four-year deal with Arsenal.\\nThe season started on 18 August 2001 and ended on 11 May 2002.\\nAt the start of 2002 the title race was wide open, with the likes of Newcastle United and Leeds United contesting at the top of the table along with the usual likes of Arsenal and Manchester United. Newcastle, after back-to-back away wins at Arsenal and Leeds during the Christmas period, confirmed themselves as genuine title challengers and led the league at the turn of the year. Leeds had topped the table at Christmas prior to losing at Elland Road to Newcastle.\\nDespite being top of the table at the start of December – eleven points clear of Manchester United – Liverpool underwent a severe slump, falling to fifth place, five points behind United. Would-be contenders Chelsea, Newcastle United and Leeds United had by this point disappeared into the chasing pack.\\nJanuary saw Liverpool travelling to both Highbury and Old Trafford in the space of a fortnight. Liverpool's Danny Murphy scored a late winner to give the Merseyside club all three points against United, and John Arne Riise then salvaged a point for Liverpool against Arsenal, allowing Manchester United to top the table for the first time that season.\\nIn March, Arsenal were installed as strong favourites for the Premiership title after Liverpool's defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. Arsenal's April triumph against Bolton Wanderers brought them to within three points of a second Premier League title under Arsène Wenger.\\nFittingly, the Premiership title would be decided at Old Trafford as Arsenal and Manchester United faced one another in a decisive encounter. Arsenal only required a draw to guarantee their second title in five seasons to go with their FA Cup victory against London rivals Chelsea four days previously; United had to win to take the title race to the last day. In the end, Arsenal emerged victorious as their record signing Sylvain Wiltord scored the only goal of the game as Arsenal was confirmed Premiership champions with a game to spare. Manchester United's disappointment was compounded by Liverpool leapfrogging them into second place by virtue of their 4–3 victory against Blackburn Rovers.\\nOn the final day of the season Liverpool confirmed second place by trashing soon to be relegated Ipswich Town 5–0 at Anfield. Arsenal rounded off their successful league campaign in style, beating Everton 4–3 at Highbury. Manchester United limped to a poor draw against Charlton Athletic, completing a disappointing campaign for the deposed league champions.\\nFor the first time in the history of the Premier League, all three promoted teams avoided relegation – Fulham, Bolton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers. Blackburn Rovers and Bolton Wanderers avoided relegation until 2011–12, when the three promoted teams of 2010–11 coincidentally avoided relegation again, whilst Fulham avoided relegation until the 2013–14 season.\\nFulham had splashed out £34\\xa0million on new players during the close season, with their owner Mohamed Al-Fayed being one of the wealthiest benefactors in English football. He even boasted that they would win the Premiership title in 2001–02, and most pundits tipped Fulham, managed by former French international Jean Tigana, to push for a place in Europe. However, Fulham finished thirteenth, 47 points away from Arsenal.\\nBolton Wanderers went top of the Premiership after winning their first three fixtures of the season, causing an upset by beating Gérard Houllier's Liverpool in the latter stage of the game. Manager Sam Allardyce was boasting that his side were good enough to win their first ever league title, but Bolton's league form slumped after the first two months of the season and they finished 16th place – their survival confirmed in the penultimate game of the season.\\nBlackburn Rovers were the most successful of the promoted sides. Graeme Souness' men beat Tottenham Hotspur 2–1 in the League Cup final to lift the trophy for the first time, and then climbed from 18th place in the Premiership in late February to finish in a secure 10th place – higher than any other newly promoted team that season. Blackburn secured a UEFA Cup place for 2002–03.\\nLeicester City was the first team officially relegated from the Premiership, finishing bottom of table with just five Premiership wins in their last season at 111-year-old Filbert Street before relocation to the new 32 000-seat Walkers Stadium. The club went through the regime of two managers during the season – Peter Taylor was replaced by Dave Bassett in early October; six months later Bassett joined the club's board to be replaced by former assistant manager Micky Adams.\\nJust after the start of the 2002–03 season, Leicester's relegation (which cost them extensive television revenue) and the cost of their new stadium had created debts in excess of £30\\xa0million, and the club went into administration before being taken over by a new owner. Despite this setback, Leicester gained promotion back to the Premiership at the first time of asking, although they slipped back down again after just one season and Adams had since resigned to make way for new manager Craig Levein.\\nNext to go down were Derby County, who had been promoted alongside Leicester six years earlier. Manager Jim Smith resigned in early October to be replaced by assistant manager Colin Todd, who was sacked three months later after Derby were knocked out of the FA Cup by Division Three strugglers Bristol Rovers.\\nThe last team to be relegated were Ipswich Town, who had qualified for the UEFA Cup and earned manager George Burley the Manager of the Year award the previous season after finishing fifth. Ipswich made a terrible start to the season, winning just one of their first 18 Premiership games. They then went on a strong run of form, winning seven out of eight games, which looked to have secured their Premiership survival, but they then suffered another setback which George Burley's men were unable to reverse, and their relegation was confirmed on the final day of the season by a 5–0 thrashing at Liverpool.\\nTwenty teams competed in the league\\xa0– the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Fulham, Blackburn Rovers and Bolton Wanderers, returning after a top flight absence of thirty-three, two and three years respectively. This was also Fulham's first season in the Premier League. They replaced Manchester City, Coventry City and Bradford City, ending their one, thirty-four and two-year top flight spells respectively.\\n\",\n",
       " \"2002–03 FA Premier League\\n\\nThe 2002–03 FA Premier League (known as the FA Barclaycard Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the 11th season of the Premier League, the top division in English football. The first matches were played on 17 August 2002 and the last were played on 11 May 2003.\\nManchester United ended the campaign as champions for the eighth time in eleven years – an achievement made all the more remarkable by the fact that defending champions Arsenal had been in the lead by eight points on 2 March. After defeating Birmingham at the start of the season, Arsenal equalled a top-flight record of fourteen straight wins but failed to extend it in their next game at West Ham United, being held to a 2–2 draw. They remained unbeaten for 30 Premier League games, 23 of which were played away, until late October, and scored in a record 55 consecutive league games, beating the previous record of 47 set by Chesterfield during the 1930-31 Third Division North season. This run ended at Old Trafford on 7 December 2002, when Manchester United won 2–0.[2] Arsenal then threw away a priceless lead against Bolton Wanderers and finally surrendered the title with a 3–2 home defeat to Leeds United in their antepenultimate game of the season, a result that also saved Leeds from relegation. Newcastle United and Chelsea were the remaining Champions League qualifiers, at the expense of Liverpool who had to settle for the UEFA Cup; they would be joined in Europe by Blackburn Rovers for a second successive season, along with Southampton who were back in Europe for the first time since 1984.\\nAt the bottom end of the table, West Ham United, West Bromwich Albion and Sunderland were relegated to the Football League First Division; West Ham's 42 points from a 38-game season was a record for a relegated team. Promoted to replace them were 2002–03 Football League First Division champions Portsmouth, runners-up Leicester City, and play-off winner Wolverhampton Wanderers.\\nTwenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Manchester City (immediately returning after a season's absence), West Bromwich Albion, and Birmingham City (both teams returning to the top flight after a sixteen-year absence). This was also both West Bromwich Albion and Birmingham City's first season in the Premier League. They replaced Ipswich Town (relegated after two seasons in the top flight), Derby County, and Leicester City (both teams relegated after a six-year presence).\\nThe PFA Players' Player of the Year award for 2003 was won by Thierry Henry of Arsenal.[31] This was the Frenchman's first award of the season and he beat off competition from the previous winner Ruud van Nistelrooy.\\nThe shortlist for the PFA Players' Player of the Year award, in alphabetical order, was as follows:\\nThe PFA Young Player of the Year award was won by Jermaine Jenas of Newcastle United.[32] Wayne Rooney was voted runner-up, and John O'Shea finished third in one of his first full seasons as a United player.\\nThe shortlist for the award was as follows:\\nThe Premier League Manager of the Year award was won by Sir Alex Ferguson[33] for winning his eighth title and regaining the league after a superb second half to the season, involving an 18-match unbeaten run.\\nThe Premier League Player of the Year award was given to Ruud van Nistelrooy,[34] whose form, creativity and goals all helped Manchester United regain the league from Arsenal.\\nThe Premier League Golden Boot award was also won by Ruud van Nistelrooy who scored 25 goals in 38 league matches and 44 in all competitions. He also equalled his record of eight goals in eight successive matches at the beginning of the season, a milestone he had reached the previous season. Van Nistelrooy finished one goal ahead of Arsenal's Thierry Henry while James Beattie managed 23 league goals for Southampton.\\nThe Premier League Golden Gloves award was given to Chelsea goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini, who proved vital in their quest for UEFA Champions League football. He kept twelve clean sheets – the most in the season – and only conceded 35 goals. Viewers of ITV's On the Ball voted Cudicini, ahead of Southampton keeper Antti Niemi, and Blackburn Rovers' Brad Friedel.[35]\\nThe annual award was won by a wonder goal from Thierry Henry against Tottenham Hotspur, on 16 November 2002, voted by viewers of ITV's The Premiership.\\nHenry – chance for a break out, Wiltord to his right, Bergkamp to his left...they'll do well to catch up with Thierry Henry though...he's drifted away from Carr – HENRY! What a fabulous solo goal by Thierry Henry. A long distance goal followed by a long distance celebration...and Arsenal are back in the goalscoring business, after their midweek blank. Henry's been short of a goal or two just recently...but look at the confidence as he breaks from inside his own half, shrugging off Etherington, stepping away from Carr and from King...and picking his spot – he had options...but he had eyes for only one thing – the back of Kasey Keller's net. Thierry Henry moves into double figures for the season.The French striker picked up the ball from his side of the pitch and ran almost 30 yards (27\\xa0m), twisting and turning the Spurs defence to unleash a thunderous shot. In celebration, he ran the distance of the whole pitch and skidded in front of the Spurs faithful. The goal proved important as it helped them regain their position at the top of the Premiership from Liverpool.\\nThe Premier League Fair Play Award was won by Manchester United.[37]\\n\",\n",
       " '2003–04 FA Premier League\\nThe 2003–04 FA Premier League (known as the FA Barclaycard Premiership) was the 12th season of the Premier League. Arsenal were crowned champions ending the season without a single defeat – the first team ever to do so in a 38-game league season. Chelsea finished second to Arsenal. \\nHaving qualified for the Champions League the previous season, Chelsea were bolstered by a £100\\xa0million outlay on world-class players, a spree funded by the extensive financial resources of their new owner Roman Abramovich. Manchester United\\'s attack was as strong as ever thanks to free-scoring Ruud van Nistelrooy, but the midfield was weakened following the £25\\xa0million pre-season sale of David Beckham to Real Madrid, and the centre of defence suffered a more severe setback after Rio Ferdinand was ruled out for the final four months of the season after being found guilty of the \"failure or refusal to take a drugs test\". The case of Rio Ferdinand started a debate about punishments relating to drug testing in football, with there being differing views on whether the punishment was too harsh or too lenient. Ferdinand\\'s club sought to make direct comparisons with an earlier case of Manchester City reserve player who had in fact committed a lesser drug testing offence and as a result escaped with only a fine.[2] City themselves had just moved from Maine Road to the City of Manchester Stadium.[3]\\nArsenal, meanwhile, had only signed German goalkeeper Jens Lehmann in the 2003 close season, but French striker Thierry Henry was instrumental in Arsenal\\'s success. Away from the Premier League, Arsène Wenger\\'s team suffered disappointment in the cup competitions. They were knocked-out by League Cup eventual winners Middlesbrough in the semi-finals. They lost their grip on the FA Cup (which they held for two seasons in a row) after being defeated by eventual winners Manchester United in the semi-final. Arsenal were knocked out of the Champions League quarter-finals by Chelsea (3–2 on aggregate). These blows in the FA Cup and Champions League came within a few days of each other, and it was feared[who?] that Arsenal might squander their lead of the Premier League for the second successive season, but Arsenal easily defeated Liverpool only days later. \\nThe 2003/04 Premier League season saw Arsène Wenger lead the North-London club to a first undefeated season, solidifying his managerial legacy and longevity to the Arsenal fanbase as they finished the season with 26 wins, 12 draws, 0 defeats and 90 points; the tied-tenth highest points tally ever seen in a premier league season, winning with an 11-point margin to Claudio Ranieri\\'s Chelsea. Thierry Henry proved decisive in the critical moments, inspiring comebacks against close rivals Liverpool and Chelsea, including a hat-trick to seal a 4-2 win from being 2-1 down initially.\\nThe relegation spots were occupied by three teams bracketed together on 33 points. Wolves and Leicester City followed the trend of many other newly promoted Premier League clubs and were relegated just one season after reaching the top division. For Leicester City, they would not return to the top flight for another 10 years and became the league champions for the first time ever in their history just a season later, whilst Wolves had been promoted back to the top flight in 2009-10 Premier League and slipped down again 3 years later. The other relegation place went to Leeds United, whose playing fortunes had dipped in the past two seasons after David O\\'Leary was sacked as manager and club debts had risen so high that many star players had to be sold. As a result, Leeds were relegated from the Premier League after 14 years of top division football – just three seasons after they had reached the Champions League semifinals, and they would not return for another 16 years.\\nIn his third season as Middlesbrough manager, Steve McClaren had guided the Teessiders to their first ever major trophy – sealed with a 2–1 win over Bolton Wanderers in the League Cup final. McClaren was also the first English manager to win a major trophy since Brian Little guided Aston Villa to League Cup success in 1996. He was also the first manager to take Middlesbrough into European competition – they would be competing in the 2004–05 UEFA Cup.\\nTwenty teams competed in the league\\xa0– the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Portsmouth, Leicester City and Wolverhampton Wanderers, returning to the top flight after an absence of fifteen, one and nineteen years respectively. This was also both Portsmouth and Wolverhampton Wanderers\\' first season in the Premier League. They replaced West Ham United, West Bromwich Albion and Sunderland after spending time in the top flight for ten, one and four years respectively.\\nThe LMA Manager of the Year award was won by Arsène Wenger.[8]\\nThe PFA Players\\' Player of the Year award for 2004 was won by Thierry Henry of Arsenal for the second successive year.[9]\\nThe shortlist for the PFA Players\\' Player of the Year award was as follows:\\nThe PFA Young Player of the Year award was won by Scott Parker of Chelsea F.C.\\nThe shortlist for the award was as follows:[10]\\nGoalkeeper: Tim Howard (Manchester United)Defence: Lauren, Ashley Cole, Sol Campbell (all Arsenal), John Terry (Chelsea)Midfield: Steven Gerrard (Liverpool), Patrick Vieira, Robert Pires (both Arsenal), Frank Lampard (Chelsea)Attack: Thierry Henry (Arsenal), Ruud van Nistelrooy (Manchester United)\\nThierry Henry of Arsenal was named the PFA Fans\\' Player of the Year for the second consecutive year. Henry was the first player to win this award twice.[11][12]\\nThe FWA Footballer of the Year award for 2004 was won by Thierry Henry. The Arsenal forward picked up a remarkable 87% of the votes.[13]\\nThe Premier League Fair Play Award merit is given to the team who has been the most sporting and best behaved team. Champions Arsenal won this.[14][15]\\nGiven to the best-behaved fans, Arsenal won this, thus achieving a fair play double.[14]\\nArsène Wenger won the Premier League Manager of the Year award. His team won 26 games, losing none and drawing 12 scoring 73 goals, conceding 26.[16]\\n',\n",
       " '2004–05 FA Premier League\\n\\nThe 2004–05 FA Premier League (known as the FA Barclays Premiership for sponsorship reasons) began on 14 August 2004 and ended on 15 May 2005. Arsenal were the defending champions after going unbeaten the previous season. Chelsea won the title with a then record 95 points, which was previously set by Manchester United in the 1993–94 season, and later surpassed by Manchester City in the 2017–18 season (100), securing the title with a 2–0 win at the Reebok Stadium against Bolton Wanderers. Chelsea also broke a number of other records during their campaign, most notably breaking the record of most games won in a single Premier League campaign, securing 29 wins in the league in home and away matches, which was later surpassed by themselves in the 2016–17 season.\\nArsenal were the favourites to defend their title after finishing the previous season unbeaten, but they also faced competition in the form of regular challengers Manchester United and Chelsea, the latter under the new management of Portuguese José Mourinho, who had just won the UEFA Champions League with Porto. Liverpool also had a new manager in Spaniard Rafael Benítez, who had just won La Liga and the UEFA Cup with Valencia and were expected to challenge for the title too. Another managerial change at a club aiming for the top was at Tottenham Hotspur, who appointed Jacques Santini, who had just led France to the quarter-finals of the 2004 European Championship.\\nAt the other end of the table, amongst those tipped for relegation were Norwich City, Crystal Palace and West Bromwich Albion, having all just been promoted from the First Division (which was rebranded this season as the Championship). Everton, Manchester City, Blackburn Rovers and Portsmouth were also tipped to struggle, the first three finishing just outside the relegation places the previous season and Portsmouth being in their second season.\\nArsenal\\'s record-breaking unbeaten streak of 49 games was ended on 24 October 2004, when Manchester United beat them 2–0 at Old Trafford.\\nFor the first time since the advent of the Premier League in 1992, no team was mathematically relegated before the final day of the season. In each of the last three weekends of the season, the team that was bottom of the table at the start of the weekend finished it outside the drop zone. The final round of the season started on 15 May with West Bromwich Albion at the bottom, Southampton and Crystal Palace one point ahead and Norwich City a further point ahead, in the last safe spot.\\nWest Brom, who had been bottom of the table and eight points from safety on Christmas Day, did their part by defeating Portsmouth at home 2–0. Norwich, the only side to have their fate completely in their own hands, lost 6–0 at Fulham and went down. Southampton lost 2–1 at home to Manchester United and were relegated after 27 years in the top flight and did not return to the top flight for 7 years. Palace, away to Charlton Athletic, were leading 2–1 after 71 minutes, but with eight minutes to go, Charlton\\'s Jonathan Fortune equalised to relegate Palace, who did not return for 8 years, where they finally avoided relegation for the first time in the Premier League era. Thus, West Brom stayed up, becoming the first club in Premier League history to avoid relegation after being bottom of the table at Christmas.\\nAt the end of the 90 minutes in all four matches, cameras focused on West Brom\\'s home ground, The Hawthorns, as confirmation of other results began to filter through. Once the realisation dawned on the players and fans that survival had been achieved, a mass pitch invasion was sparked, with huge celebrations. The Portsmouth fans joined in the celebrations as, through losing, they had \"helped\" relegate arch-rivals Southampton.\\nTwenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Norwich City, West Bromwich Albion and Crystal Palace, returning to the top flight after an absence of nine, one and six years respectively. They replaced Leicester City, Leeds United and Wolverhampton Wanderers, who had been relegated to the Championship. Leicester City and Wolverhampton Wanderers were relegated after a season\\'s presence while Leeds United ended their top flight spell of fourteen years.\\n\\nThe PFA Player\\'s Player of the year award was won by Chelsea captain John Terry.\\nThe shortlist for the PFA Players\\' Player of the Year award, in alphabetical order, was as follows:[20]\\nManchester United striker Wayne Rooney was the recipient for this award.\\nChelsea midfielder Frank Lampard won this award for the first time.\\nGoalkeeper – Petr Čech \\nDefenders – Gary Neville, John Terry, Rio Ferdinand, Ashley Cole \\nMidfielders – Shaun Wright-Phillips, Frank Lampard, Steven Gerrard, Arjen Robben \\nStrikers – Thierry Henry, Andy Johnson\\nChelsea midfielder Frank Lampard won this award.\\nChelsea\\'s midfielder Frank Lampard won the Premier League Player of the Season award.\\nArsenal and French striker Thierry Henry won the Premier League Golden Boot award for the third time in his career with 25 goals.\\nChelsea goalkeeper Petr Čech won the Premier League Golden Glove, for 25 clean sheets, in his debut season as he set a remarkable record of 10 consecutive clean sheets, as Chelsea won the title.\\nJosé Mourinho was awarded the Premier League Manager of the Season award after he led Chelsea to their first Premier League title, second Top division title in their history.[21][22] During his first season at the club, Chelsea won the Premier League title (their first league title in 50 years) and the League Cup. The season was also notable for the number of records set during the season: Fewest goals against in a Premier League season (15), most clean sheets kept in a season (25), most wins in a season (29), most consecutive away wins (9) and the most points in a season (95).\\nThe Premier League Fair Play Award is merit given to the team who has been the most sporting and best behaved team. Arsenal won the award for the second year in a row, ahead of Tottenham.[23] The least sporting side for 2004–05 was Blackburn Rovers, who achieved a significantly lower fair play score than any other side.[24]\\n',\n",
       " \"2005–06 FA Premier League\\n\\nThe 2005–06 FA Premier League (known as the FA Barclays Premiership for sponsorship reasons) began on 13 August 2005, and concluded on 7 May 2006. The season saw Chelsea retain their title after defeating Manchester United 3–0 at Stamford Bridge towards the end of April. On the same day, West Bromwich Albion and Birmingham City were relegated, joining Sunderland in the Championship for the following season. Chelsea drew the record they set  the previous season, with 29 wins in home and away campaigns.[citation needed]\\nSeveral clubs reported disappointing attendances and/or trouble selling out their grounds for the opening weeks' matches. Many have argued that this was due mainly to the comparatively early season start and the Ashes Test cricket series which caught the nation's imagination and which England went on to win. Other possible reasons are continued escalation of ticket prices and the increasing number of games shown on television (which has had the knock on effect of greater variation in kick-off times). The overall decline in attendances for the season was only around 2%, but that figure is reduced by the fact that bigger clubs were promoted into the Premiership than were relegated and several clubs have suffered larger falls.[citation needed]\\nFor the second time in two seasons, José Mourinho's Chelsea triumphed in the Premier League, with a home win over closest rivals Manchester United confirming them as champions after a record setting albeit tense season.[citation needed]\\nChelsea's early season form with 14 wins out of 16 gave the champions an unequivocal head start. With Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool falling way short of their expectations before Christmas, Chelsea had effectively become champions-elect by early 2006. However, a sudden collapse in form by mid-March caused their seemingly unassailable lead of 16 points to be cut to just 7 in two months due to the impressive late run of form of Manchester United, who went on a nine-match winning streak scoring over 20 goals. However, a shock home draw with bottom of the table Sunderland at Old Trafford killed United's title hopes. The momentum was back with Chelsea who didn't need a second bite at the apple with wins over Bolton, Everton and finally Manchester United giving the west Londoners their second successive championship under Mourinho.[citation needed]\\nThe top two clubs at the end of the season earned the right to participate in the UEFA Champions League group stages, while the third- and fourth-placed clubs get places in the Champions League Third Qualifying Round (where they progress to the Champions League group stages if they win or the UEFA Cup if they lose). However, if an English team wins the Champions League, but finishes outside the top four, then they get the final Champions League spot instead of the fourth-placed club, who have to settle for a place in the UEFA Cup. This could have been the case with Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, but Arsenal pipped Spurs to fourth place in the final matchday of the season before losing 2–1 to FC Barcelona in the final of the UEFA Champions League.[citation needed]\\nThe fifth-placed club always earns a spot in the UEFA Cup. The winners of the FA Cup also earn a place in the UEFA Cup. If they have already qualified for European competition by their league position or winning the League Cup, then the FA Cup runners-up get their place. If the runners-up, too, have already qualified, then the highest league finisher who have not already qualified for Europe (normally sixth place) are given the place. This season, the FA Cup final featured Liverpool and West Ham. Since Liverpool finished third they were assured of a spot in the Champions League qualifying round, which in turn meant that West Ham received the cup winner's UEFA Cup place.[citation needed]\\nThe League Cup winners also qualify for the UEFA Cup. If they have already qualified for European competition through other means then their place is, unlike the FA Cup, not awarded to the runner-up, but instead the highest league finisher who has not qualified for Europe. League Cup winners Manchester United finished second, placing them directly into the Champions League group stage. This meant that the sixth-placed club, Blackburn Rovers, qualified for the UEFA Cup. The team directly after the UEFA Cup places, goes into the UEFA Intertoto Cup which means in turn, if the team – Newcastle United this season – wins a 2-legged match means they earn a place in the qualifying round of the UEFA Cup.[citation needed]\\n2005-06 also saw the final action of two of the most successful players in English football, Alan Shearer (last played for Newcastle United) and Dennis Bergkamp (last played for Arsenal).\\nTwenty teams competed in the league\\xa0– the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams were Sunderland, Wigan Athletic and West Ham United. Sunderland and West Ham United returned to the top flight after an absence of two years while Wigan Athletic played in the top flight for the first time in history.

This left them seven points behind United, with two games to go, confirming the Manchester club as champions once more.\\nThe three relegation spots were occupied by Watford and Sheffield United who each lasted one season in the league, along with Charlton Athletic who went down after seven seasons.\\nTwenty teams competed in the league\\xa0– the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams were Reading (playing in the top flight for the first time ever), Sheffield United (playing top flight football for the first time in twelve years) and Watford (returning after a six-year absence). They replaced Birmingham City, West Bromwich Albion and Sunderland, ending their top flight spells of four, two and one year respectively.\\n(as of 13 May 2007)\\nThe Premier League expected to have the league\\'s 15,000th goal scored at some point in the period between Christmas and New Year. The target was reached on 30 December when Moritz Volz scored for Fulham against Chelsea. Barclays, the Premiership\\'s sponsor, donated £15,000 to the Fulham Community Sports Trust in Volz\\' name.  Additionally, a fan who correctly predicted that Volz would score the historic goal in a contest presented the player with a special award prior to Fulham\\'s game against Watford at Craven Cottage on 1 January.[15] The honour of scoring the 15,000th goal led to Volz being nicknamed \"15,000 Volz\".[citation needed]\\nOn 17 March 2007, Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Paul Robinson scored against Watford from an 83-yard free kick, which bounced over his England teammate Ben Foster, who was in goal for the Hornets, leading Spurs to a 3–1 win at White Hart Lane.[16] This was the third goal scored by a goalkeeper in Premiership history. The other two were scored by Peter Schmeichel, for Aston Villa against Everton on 21 October 2001,[17] and Brad Friedel, for Blackburn Rovers against Charlton Athletic on 21 February 2004.[18] In those two cases, the teams they played for lost. Robinson became the first keeper to score for the winning team in a Premiership match.\\nWest Ham escaped relegation on the final day of the season with a 1–0 win over Manchester United, with Carlos Tevez scoring the winner.[19] Sheffield United were relegated, along with Charlton and Watford. Tevez was subsequently found to have been ineligible to play, as he was not owned by West Ham, but by a third party. Sheffield United sued to keep their Premier League status and, when that failed, went to an FA arbitration panel seeking up to £30m compensation. The arbitration panel found in favour of Sheffield United.[20] The two clubs subsequently settled out of court for an undisclosed sum.[21]\\nThis season\\'s awards were dominated by Manchester United, who, as a team, picked up a total of eight individual awards, five of which went to Cristiano Ronaldo.

The first matches of the season were played on 11 August 2007, and the season ended on 11 May 2008. Manchester United went into the 2007–08 season as the Premier League\\'s defending champions, having won their ninth Premier League title and sixteenth league championship overall the previous season. This season was also the third consecutive season to see the \"Big Four\" continue their stranglehold on the top four spots (which mean UEFA Champions League qualification).\\nThe first goal of the season was scored by Michael Chopra, who scored a 94th-minute winner for Sunderland against Tottenham in the early kick-off.[3] The first red card of the season was given to Reading\\'s Dave Kitson after a challenge on Patrice Evra in their opening game against Manchester United.[4] The first hat-trick was scored by Emmanuel Adebayor in the match between Arsenal and Derby County.[5]\\nOn 29 September 2007, Portsmouth beat Reading 7–4 in the highest-scoring match in Premier League history.[6] On 15 December 2007, both Roque Santa Cruz (Blackburn Rovers) and Marcus Bent (Wigan Athletic) scored hat-tricks during Wigan\\'s 5–3 home win over Blackburn.

Meanwhile, despite Birmingham beating Blackburn Rovers 4–1 and Reading beating Derby 4–0, both Birmingham and Reading were relegated due to Fulham\\'s 1–0 win over Portsmouth. This meant that Fulham avoided relegation by a goal difference of −22, compared to Reading\\'s −25. On the same day, Middlesbrough beat Manchester City 8–1 to claim the biggest win of the season.\\nThe season was notable for the return of the English league to the top of UEFA\\'s official ranking list, overtaking La Liga for the period from 1 May 2008 to 30 April 2009. This followed the success of English clubs in the UEFA Champions League, with both champions Manchester United and runners-up Chelsea reaching the European Cup final. This was the first time that the English league had topped the UEFA rankings since the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985.\\nTwenty teams competed in the league\\xa0– the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams were Sunderland, Birmingham City (both teams returning after a season\\'s absence) and Derby County (returning after a five-year absence).

       " '2008–09 Premier League\\nThe 2008–09 Premier League (known as the Barclays Premier League for sponsorship reasons) was the 17th season since the establishment of the Premier League in 1992. Manchester United became champions for the 11th time on the penultimate weekend of the season, defending their crown after winning their tenth Premier League title on the final day of the previous season. They were run close by Liverpool, who had a better goal difference and who had beaten United home and away, including a 4–1 victory at Old Trafford, but who were undone by a series of draws. The campaign – the fixtures for which were announced on 16 June 2008 – began on Saturday, 16 August 2008,[2] and ended on 24 May 2009. A total of 20 teams contested the league, consisting of 17 who competed in the previous season and three promoted from the Football League Championship. The new match ball was the Nike T90 Omni.\\nAt the start of this season, clubs were allowed to name seven substitutes on the bench instead of five.[3] This season was also different in that there was no New Year\\'s Day game, as is traditional. This was because the FA Cup Third Round is traditionally played on the first Saturday in January, which in 2009 fell in the usual spot for New Year\\'s league games.[4] September saw Manchester City taken over by the Abu Dhabi United Group, transforming them into one of the world\\'s wealthiest football clubs, securing the signing of Robinho for a British record £32.5\\xa0million just seconds before the 2008 summer transfer window closed in the process.[5]\\nThe first goal of the season was scored by Arsenal\\'s Samir Nasri against newly promoted West Bromwich Albion in the fourth minute of the early kick-off game on the opening day of the season on 16 August.[6] Gabriel Agbonlahor of Aston Villa scored the first hat-trick of the season against Manchester City, scoring three goals in the space of seven minutes.[7] Manchester United clinched the 2009 Premier League title with a scoreless draw against Arsenal on 16 May 2009, their 11th Premier League title, and 18th League title overall, drawing level with fierce rivals Liverpool who finished as runners-up. It is the second time they clinched the title for three consecutive years, the first being in 2001.\\nWest Bromwich Albion were the first team to be relegated to the Championship after losing 2–0 at home to Liverpool on 17 May 2009. They were joined in the Championship by Middlesbrough and Newcastle United on the last day of the season after Middlesbrough\\'s defeat at West Ham United and Newcastle\\'s 1–0 defeat at Aston Villa. It meant that Hull City and Sunderland stayed up despite home defeats to Manchester United and Chelsea respectively. The fact that Hull City avoided relegation (along with Stoke City, who stayed up relatively comfortably under the management of Tony Pulis), meant it was the first time since the 2005–06 season that more than one promoted club maintained their Premier League status. Aston Villa, Everton and Fulham all secured European football for the 2009–10 season through their league position.[8]\\nTwenty teams competed in the league\\xa0– the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams were West Bromwich Albion, Stoke City (returning to the top flight after absences of two and twenty-three years respectively) and Hull City (playing top flight football for the first time ever). This was also Stoke City\\'s first season in the Premier League. They replaced Reading (ending their two-year top flight spell), Birmingham City and Derby County (both teams relegated after a season\\'s presence).\\n(as of 24 May 2009)\\nAlso, Nike provided new match balls, white with red and yellow (autumn/spring) and yellow with purple and black (winter), based on their T90 Laser II Omni model.\\nSir Alex Ferguson, 67, picked up the Premier League Manager of the Season for the ninth time.

The Liverpool captain saw off the challenges of Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs and forward Wayne Rooney, who finished second and third respectively.\\nChelsea striker Nicolas Anelka won the Premier League Golden Boot award for the first time. He scored 19 goals in 35 appearances, which ensured he finished as the season\\'s top scorer.\\nManchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar collected the Premier League Golden Glove award for the first time. He kept a total of 21 clean sheets in 33 appearances, including a record run of 11 consecutive clean sheets (1,311\\xa0minutes) from Stoke City on 15 November 2008 to West Bromwich Albion on 27 January 2009.\\nThe Premier League Fair Play Award is merit given to the team who has been the most sporting and best behaved team.

In recognition for leading his club to the top of the Fair Play league, the Premier League Spirit Award for 2008–09 was given to Fulham manager Roy Hodgson.[73]\\nGiven to the best-behaved fans, Fulham won this for the third consecutive year, rounding off a hat-trick of sporting awards.[65]\\n',\n",
       " \"2009–10 Premier League\\n\\nThe 2009–10 Premier League (known as the Barclays Premier League for sponsorship reasons) was the 18th season of the Premier League since its establishment in 1992. A total of 20 teams competed in the league, with Chelsea unseating the three-time defending champions Manchester United, scoring a then Premier League record 103 goals in the process.[4][5] The season began on 15 August 2009 and concluded on 9 May 2010.[6] Prior to each opening week match, a minute's applause was held in memory of Sir Bobby Robson. Nike provided a new match ball\\xa0– the T90 Ascente\\xa0– for this season. Barclays sponsored the league.\\nThe race for the title went to the final day of the season with Chelsea one point ahead of Manchester United; Chelsea's 8–0 win over Wigan Athletic was enough to secure their first title since 2006, despite Manchester United's 4–0 defeat of Stoke City.[7] The title win came in Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti's first season at the club and he followed this up a week later by securing Chelsea's first FA Cup and League double with a win over Portsmouth at Wembley. Chelsea striker Didier Drogba won the Golden Boot award as the league's top goalscorer for the second time[8] The victorious Chelsea side were noted for their attacking style of football: the team averaged 2.71 goals per game, scoring a Premier League record 103 goals for the season, compared to the average of 1.89 when they won the title in the 2004–05 and 2005–06 seasons.[9]\\nIn February 2010, Portsmouth became the first club to go into administration whilst a member of the Premier League.[10] They were docked nine points, and two months later they were the first team of the season to be relegated. Hull City and Premier League debutants Burnley were relegated alongside them.\\nPre-season was overshadowed by the death of Sir Bobby Robson on 31 July. On the opening games of the season, players stood around the centre circle for a minute's applause for the former Newcastle United, Fulham, Ipswich Town, Barcelona, Porto, PSV and England manager who died at the age of 76.\\nThis season was the last of a three-year domestic television rights deal agreed in 2006. Television rights continue to provide a large portion of Premier League clubs' revenue. However, on 19 June 2009, the Premier League annulled its contract with Ireland-based broadcaster Setanta Sports after the company failed to pay an instalment to the league with speculation mounting that the company would enter administration. As a result, Setanta Sports' share was bought by United States-based broadcasters ESPN, while Sky Sports continue to hold four of the six 23-live match packages.[11] In the United States, the Disney-owned network is making use of sibling-network ESPN2 to televise early Saturday matches and Monday matches. This was possible due to Setanta Sports' financial troubles, which required their USA-based North America division to sell its rights to those games back to Fox Sports International, who in turn sublicensed them to ESPN. Setanta continues to broadcast a reduced number of matches in Ireland. In Australia, most games are available live on Fox Sports. Sentanta Sports USA operations ceased on 28 February, and Fox Soccer Plus replaced Sentanta as a pay service the following day.\\nOn 31 January 2010, Sky Sports broadcast the match between Arsenal and Manchester United in 3D. The 3D broadcast was shown at nine pubs in London, Manchester, Cardiff, Edinburgh and Dublin, making the match the first sports event to be televised in 3D to a public audience anywhere in the world.[12][13]\\nChelsea won the league by a point over second placed Manchester United on 9 May 2010, with an 8–0 win at home to Wigan Athletic. They won despite Manchester United's 4–0 win against Stoke. The title win came in Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti's first season with the club. Portsmouth were the first team to be relegated on 10 April 2010, followed by Hull City and Burnley.[14][15][16] Fulham's manager Roy Hodgson was voted manager of the year by the League Managers Association.[17] The season saw Liverpool, runners-up the previous season and considered one of the established 'Big Four', finish outside the top four for the first time since 2004–05 leaving them unable to compete in the UEFA Champions League for the first time since the 2003–04 season. Tottenham Hotspur finished with their best point total at the time in the Premier League era, finishing in fourth place on 70 points, earning their first ever berth into the Champions league.\\nTwenty teams competed in the league\\xa0– the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams were Wolverhampton Wanderers, Birmingham City and Burnley returning to the top flight after absences of five, one and thirty-three years respectively. This was also Burnley's first season in the Premier League.

The 2010–11 fixtures were released on 17 June 2010 at 09:00 BST.[2] The season began on 14 August 2010,[3] and ended on 22 May 2011. Chelsea were the defending champions.[4]\\nManchester United secured the title with a 1–1 draw away to Blackburn Rovers on 14 May 2011.[5][6]\\nThis was their nineteenth English league title, breaking a tie with Liverpool which had stood since Manchester United won their eighteenth title in 2009.[7] Manchester United, Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal all secured a berth for the 2011–12 UEFA Champions League, while Tottenham Hotspur qualified for the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League via league position. At the bottom, West Ham United, Blackpool, and Birmingham City were relegated to the Championship.[8][9][10]\\nThe Premier League introduced a cap on the number of players in a squad. From this season onwards, clubs had to declare a squad of no more than 25 players when the summer transfer window shuts, and then again at the end of the January transfer window. Players aged 21 and under could be selected without being registered in the 25.\\nAlso being introduced this season was the \"home grown players\" rule, which aims to encourage the development of young footballers at Premier League clubs. The new rule required clubs to name at least eight players in their squad of 25 players that have been registered domestically for a minimum of three seasons prior to their 21st birthday.[11]\\nAll of the Premier League teams submitted their 25-man squads on 1 September 2010 deadline.[12]\\nTwenty teams competed in the league\\xa0– the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship.

       " \"2011–12 Premier League\\nThe 2011–12 Premier League (known as the Barclays Premier League for sponsorship reasons) was the 20th season of the Premier League since its establishment in 1992. The season began on 13 August 2011 and ended on 13 May 2012 with Manchester City sealing their third league title – their first since 1968 – with victory over Queens Park Rangers on the final day. The title was City's first Premier League success, making them the fifth club to win the Premier League in its 20-year history.[3] City finished level on 89 points with Manchester United, but their goal difference was eight better than their local rivals', making it the only time the Premier League had been won on goal difference.\\nThe league was contested by 20 teams, 17 returning from the 2010–11 season and three promoted from the Football League Championship. Championship winners Queens Park Rangers and runners-up Norwich City gained automatic promotion whilst Swansea City gained promotion through the Football League Championship play-offs beating Reading 4–2 in May 2011, becoming the first non-English team to play in the Premier League. All three promoted clubs avoided relegation for the first time since the 2001–02 campaign. The season was voted as the greatest Premier League season in the Premier League 20 Seasons Awards.[4]\\nManchester City won the title in a tense finale, their first championship since 1968. City's local rivals Manchester United were the early pace-setters, leading the table until October when they drew at Liverpool allowing Manchester City to overtake them. The following week, City increased their lead to five points with a shock 6–1 away victory at Old Trafford, which they maintained until December, when they dropped points and their lead narrowed, but City remained in front until March, when a defeat at Swansea City saw them drop behind United. City's bad form continued for the next month while United went on a winning run, so that with six matches remaining United were eight points ahead of City and the title seemingly decided. However, United then faltered with a defeat and a draw in their next three games, while City won all three to narrow the gap to three points. City then beat United 1–0 at the City of Manchester Stadium to move back ahead of United on goal difference. Both sides won their penultimate matches to maintain the status quo.\\nGoing into the final matches, which were played simultaneously, City were top of the league, ahead of Manchester United on goal difference. However, a Wayne Rooney goal away to Sunderland gave United the advantage. A 39th-minute goal from Pablo Zabaleta, his first of the season, put City back on top at half time. In a dramatic second half Djibril Cissé equalised for Queens Park Rangers in the 48th minute. Shortly after, Joey Barton of QPR was sent off for elbowing Carlos Tevez; on his way off the pitch, he kicked Sergio Agüero, attempted to headbutt Vincent Kompany and squared up to Mario Balotelli. Despite the numerical advantage, City went behind after Jamie Mackie gave QPR the lead in the 66th minute. As time wound down in both matches, it appeared that Manchester United would win the title with their victory over Sunderland. But Edin Džeko equalised for City in the 92nd minute. While United players waited on the field at Sunderland for a possible trophy presentation, Manchester City's Sergio Agüero scored the game winner in the 94th minute to clinch the title on goal difference.[5][6] The 6–1 loss was even more important than it seemed at the time, because if City had won by a single goal then both teams would have ended with identical records (points, goal difference, goals scored, win record, etc.) which by Premier League rules would have meant a play-off game at a neutral ground to decide the title.[7]\\nFor most of the season, Tottenham Hotspur were in third place, a couple of points behind the Manchester clubs, and there was much speculation as to whether Tottenham could mount a title challenge. However, from late February onward their season collapsed, starting with a 5–2 defeat to local rivals Arsenal, whom they had been 10 points ahead of before the game, and just four wins in their last 13 games condemned Tottenham to finishing a point below Arsenal, who finished third to join Manchester City and Manchester United in the UEFA Champions League,[8] Arsenal completed a strong recovery from a disastrous start to the season including their 8–2 defeat at Manchester United in August. Tottenham finished in the fourth and final Champions League slot but missed out on qualification for the competition because Chelsea's victory in the 2012 Champions League Final automatically entitled them to defend their title in the 2012–13 tournament at the expense of the lowest ranked team that would otherwise qualify for the competition through league position. This was the first time that this rule had been implemented in the Premier League, having been introduced by UEFA after Liverpool's controversial qualification for the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League. This consequently marked the first time that the club finishing fourth in the Premier League had not qualified for the tournament since the fourth qualifying spot was introduced in the 2001–02 season. Newcastle United finished fifth and qualified for the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League.[9] Everton finished 7th, just above local rivals Liverpool. Despite finishing above them for the first time in seven years, it was Liverpool who claimed the final Europa League slot, by virtue of winning the 2011–12 Football League Cup.[10]\\nElsewhere in the league, QPR avoided relegation, despite losing to Manchester City; Bolton Wanderers could only draw at Stoke City, failing to overtake QPR, and therefore joining Blackburn Rovers and Wolverhampton Wanderers in being relegated to the Championship. For the second time in the Premier League's history, none of the three clubs promoted from the Championship in the previous season were relegated at the end of the season with the other two teams, Swansea City and Norwich City, finishing 11th and 12th respectively. The last time all three newly promoted teams stayed up (2001–02), Blackburn and Bolton were two of those teams.\\nLiverpool's Luis Suárez was found guilty of racially abusing Manchester United's Patrice Evra and was given an eight-match ban.\\nTwenty teams competed in the league\\xa0– the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams were Queens Park Rangers, Norwich City and Swansea City, returning to the top flight after absences of fifteen, six and twenty-eight years respectively. This was also Swansea City's first season in the Premier League. They replaced Birmingham City, Blackpool and West Ham United, ending their top-flight spells of two, one and six years respectively. This was the first season in the Premier League era where a Welsh team competed and the first season where a Welsh team competed in the top flight of English football since the 1982–83 season.\\nNote: Flags indicate national team as has been defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

He was given £20,000 from league sponsor Barclays to donate to a charity of his choice. He chose Acorns Children's Hospice, who used to sponsor Aston Villa.[56]\\nNewcastle United manager Alan Pardew, 50, received the Premier League Manager of the Season.[72] Pardew was the first Newcastle manager to receive the award, and only the second Englishman after Harry Redknapp to do so.\\nThe Premier League Player of the Season award was won by Vincent Kompany of Manchester City.[72]\\nThe Goal of the Season award was given to Papiss Cissé of Newcastle United for his second goal in their 2–0 victory against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 28 April, becoming the first player for the club to win the award since its inception.\\nThe PFA Players' Player of the Year was awarded to Robin van Persie.[73] The other nominees were; Sergio Aguero, Scott Parker, David Silva, Joe Hart and Wayne Rooney.[74]\\nThe PFA Young Player of the Year was awarded to Kyle Walker.[76]\\nThe FWA Footballer of the Year was also awarded to Robin van Persie.[77]\\nThe Premier League Golden Boot award went to Robin van Persie, who scored 30 goals.\\nThe Premier League Golden Glove award was won by Joe Hart of Manchester City, who achieved 17 clean sheets.\\nSwansea City won the Premier League Fair Play Award after finishing the 2011–12 Premier League top of the Fair Play Table.

The fixture schedule was released on 18 June 2012.[3][4] The season began on 18 August 2012 and ended on 19 May 2013.[4]\\nManchester City were the defending champions, having won their first Premier League title the previous season. This was their first top division league title since the 1967–68 season.\\nOn 22 April 2013, Manchester United won their 13th Premier League title and 20th English title overall by defeating Aston Villa 3–0 at Old Trafford. This left reigning champions Manchester City 16 points behind with only 15 left to play for.[5] It was the first time the title had been decided in April since Chelsea were the winners in 2005–06. It was also only the fourth time in the history of the Premier League that it had been won with at least four games remaining in the season, the last time being in 2003–04 when Arsenal were champions.[citation needed] England national football team manager, Roy Hodgson declared that United\\'s manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, was a \"magician\" having won 13 titles in 21 seasons.[6]\\nOn 28 April 2013, Queens Park Rangers and Reading were both relegated from the Premier League after a 0–0 draw against each other.[7] Wigan Athletic were the third and final club to be relegated, after a 4–1 defeat to Arsenal on 14 May 2013. This brought an end to their eight-year stay in the Premier League, and came three days after winning the season\\'s FA Cup.  This made them the first club to win the FA Cup and suffer relegation in the same season.[8]\\nThe season opened the weekend of 18 August 2012. Defending champions Manchester City opened their season with a narrow 3–2 victory over Southampton, who had just been promoted back to the Premier League after seven seasons in lower divisions. Man City had taken a 1–0 lead, with Southampton turning it on its head to go 2–1 up with 20 minutes remaining. City eventually came back and Samir Nasri scored the winning goal with ten minutes left.[9] In a Monday evening fixture at Goodison Park, Manchester United started their season with a 1–0 loss to Everton, the goal scored by Marouane Fellaini.[10] The first goal of the season, however, was scored by Swansea City\\'s Michu,[11] whose team thrashed Queens Park Rangers 5–0 away from home.[12]\\nManchester United recovered from their opening week loss with a 3–2 win over Fulham in their opening home game at Old Trafford, but lost striker Wayne Rooney to injury during the match.[13] Other second week highlights included Chelsea\\'s 2–0 win over Newcastle United, with recent Belgian signing Eden Hazard involved in both goals.[14][15]\\nEarly leaders Chelsea had week three off, while a win by Manchester City over Queens Park Rangers left the defending champions two points off the pace. The game was a highly anticipated rematch between the two teams that squared off on the final day of the 2011–12 season, when Manchester City snatched the title on goal difference with a late goal by Sergio Agüero. This time though, it was less exciting, with Manchester City comfortably winning 3–1.[16] Level on points with Manchester City in second place were Swansea City, who registered a 2–2 draw with Sunderland, and West Bromwich Albion, who defeated Everton 2–0.[17]\\nThe fourth week of the season began with controversy, as the Chelsea v Queens Park Rangers match was fraught with racial tensions when QPR\\'s Anton Ferdinand refused to shake hands with Chelsea\\'s John Terry, who had been suspended for four games for using racial epithets against Ferdinand during the previous season.[18] The teams would play out a 0–0 draw, however second place Manchester City could not gain ground as they also drew, with Stoke City.[19]\\nWeek five saw Chelsea extend their league lead to 3 points with a 1–0 win over Stoke City. A late goal in the 85th minute by Ashley Cole secured the win for the Blues.[20] Everton and West Bromwich Albion maintained control of second place, with both teams notching a win in week five, though a draw by the Baggies in week six would drop them back to fifth place, which they would share with Tottenham Hotspur following their surprise 3–2 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford. Chelsea, Everton, and Manchester City would all win in week six. The results table after six games would have Chelsea in the lead with 16 points, followed by Everton and Manchester City with 13 points each, and Manchester United with 12. At the bottom of the league, Liverpool forward Luis Suárez scored a hat trick against Norwich City, leading Liverpool to a 5–2 victory. It was the second consecutive year that Suárez had scored a hat trick at Carrow Road.[21]\\nThe month of October saw a tightening at the top of the standings, with Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City all winning their first two of three games for the month, setting up a vital Sunday afternoon match at Stamford Bridge between third placed Manchester United and the leaders Chelsea. The game did not disappoint, as Chelsea went down 2–0 early on an own goal by David Luiz in the fourth minute and a goal by Robin van Persie in the 12th. Van Persie had also taken the shot that had rebounded off of Luiz, and thus was ultimately responsible for the Red Devil\\'s one-goal lead at half-time, following a late first half goal by Chelsea\\'s Juan Mata from a free kick. Eight minutes into the second half Ramires equalised for Chelsea, and in the 75th minute United\\'s Javier Hernández scored what proved to be the deciding goal via a rebound from a missed Van Persie shot. Replays showed that Hernández was in an offside position, generating a great deal of controversy. After the game, only a single point separated leaders Chelsea from second placed Manchester United.[22] The rest of the standings were tightly packed in mid-table as 4 points separated fourth through ninth place. Another key match in October included a fixture between Liverpool and Reading, with Liverpool winning 1–0 (with winger Raheem Sterling scoring his first goal for the club) and giving manager Brendan Rodgers his first win at Anfield in the league against Reading, a team he formerly managed.[23] The final week of October featured the longest match in the 20-year history of the Premier League, a 103-minute game between Manchester City and Swansea that featured two serious injuries, one to the groin of Swansea keeper Michel Vorm and the other to the knee of Manchester City back Micah Richards, both of which required stretchers to carry them off. City prevailed 1–0 in the marathon event with a goal from Carlos Tevez.[24][25]\\nLeague leaders Chelsea suffered a dip in form in November. They opened the month with draws against Swansea City and Liverpool, dropping them to third in the standings. A loss to West Bromwich Albion on 17 November was marked by ineffective second half play, as the team was unable to capitalise on a late first half equaliser by Eden Hazard.[26] The Blues closed out the month with uninspiring 0–0 draws against Manchester City and Fulham. The primary beneficiaries of Chelsea\\'s slide were Manchester United and Manchester City, as the two rivals moved into commanding control of the first two places in the league table. Key November games included a 2–1 Manchester United win over Arsenal on 3 November,[27] and a dominating 5–0 win by Manchester City over Aston Villa on 17 November marked by a pair of two-goal performances by Carlos Tevez and Sergio Aguero.[28] West Bromwich Albion proved to be the biggest mover up the league table, moving from eighth up to joint third with Chelsea, on the strength of four wins over Southampton, Wigan Athletic, Chelsea, and Sunderland. At the bottom end of the table, Queens Park Rangers found themselves as the only team without a league win by the end of November.\\nThe month of December saw minimal change in the standings at the top end of the table. The situation by New Year\\'s Eve with the top three places was the same as it was at the start of the month, though Manchester United had extended their lead over second place Manchester City to seven points, with Chelsea four points back from City in third place. Tottenham Hotspur occupied fourth place with Arsenal, Everton, and West Bromwich Albion all tied for fifth. Chelsea stopped their November slide with a 3–1 win at Sunderland on 8 December on the strength of two goals by Fernando Torres.[29] The Manchester derby was renewed on 9 December at the City of Manchester Stadium with first place on the line. United took a two-goal lead thanks to two goals from Wayne Rooney in the 16th and 30th minute. City responded with a Yaya Touré goal in the 60th minute, a goal that followed two saves in rapid succession by United keeper David de Gea. Pablo Zabaleta equalised in the 86th minute, but Robin van Persie once again proved to be the hero for United, scoring the winning goal two minutes into injury time to extend United\\'s lead over City at the top of the table to six points.[30] The last team without a league win, Queens Park Rangers, finally got their first win of the season on 15 December.\\nTwenty teams competed in the league\\xa0– the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams were Reading, Southampton and West Ham United, returning to the top flight after absences of four, seven and one year respectively. They replaced Bolton Wanderers, Blackburn Rovers (both teams relegated after eleven years in the top flight) and Wolverhampton Wanderers (ending their three-year top flight spell).\\nNote: Flags indicate national team as has been defined under FIFA eligibility rules.

       " '2015–16 Premier League\\nThe 2015–16 Premier League (known as the Barclays Premier League for sponsorship reasons) was the 24th season of the Premier League, the top English professional league for association football clubs, since its establishment in 1992, and the 117th season of top-flight English football overall. The season began on 8 August 2015, and was scheduled to conclude on 15 May 2016.[6] However, the match between Manchester United and Bournemouth on the final day was postponed to 17 May 2016 due to a suspicious package found at Old Trafford.[7]\\nChelsea began the season as defending champions of the 2014–15 season. Bournemouth, Watford and Norwich City entered as the three promoted teams from the 2014–15 Football League Championship.\\nLeicester City, managed by Italian Claudio Ranieri, won the championship for the first time in their 132-year history, with 2 games to spare, after Tottenham failed to beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 2 May 2016, becoming the 24th club to become English football champions, and the sixth club to win the Premier League. Many commentators consider this to be one of the greatest sporting shocks in history, especially given that Leicester spent a great deal of the previous season at the bottom of the table before rallying towards the season\\'s end to finish 14th. Bookmakers gave the Foxes 5000/1 odds of winning the league at the beginning of the season.\\nLeicester striker Jamie Vardy\\'s goal against Manchester United on 28 November 2015 meant he had scored in 11 consecutive matches, surpassing Ruud van Nistelrooy\\'s Premier League record of 10 straight games with a goal, which he set in 2003.[8]\\nAston Villa, one of seven teams who had played in the Premier League since its inaugural season, were relegated from the top flight in England for the first time since 1987.\\nLeicester celebrated their title win with renditions of \"Nessun dorma\" and \"Con te partirò\" by Andrea Bocelli, who sang for the Leicester fans on the pitch of the King Power Stadium in May.\\nLeicester City were the surprise of the season. Following their late escape from relegation in the previous season many pundits had predicted that they would be relegated[9] and bookmakers gave 5,000–1 odds on them winning the title.[10] After the dismissal of manager Nigel Pearson, they began the new season with Italian Claudio Ranieri in charge. Pearson had been known for his short temper with the press, while Ranieri has a reputation for good humour.[11] The appointment was met with scepticism by pundits, including Leicester fan and former player Gary Lineker, as Ranieri had recently been sacked from his previous post as manager of the Greece national team after suffering a humiliating defeat to the Faroe Islands in his last game in charge.[11][12]\\nDespite winning their opening game against Sunderland and topping the table, they dropped back following a 5–2 home defeat to Arsenal in September.[13] However, aided by Jamie Vardy\\'s record feat of scoring in eleven consecutive Premier League games,[1] they then remained unbeaten – and returned to the top of the table – until 26 December, when a 1–0 defeat to Liverpool dropped them to second place. They returned to the top after a 1–1 draw with Aston Villa on 16 January, and remained there for the rest of the season.[13] Following a 2–2 draw between Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur at Stamford Bridge on 2 May 2016, and having two more games to play, Leicester City were confirmed champions, their first title in the top flight of English football, eclipsing the runners-up spot they reached in 1929.[10]\\nDefending champions Chelsea sacked manager José Mourinho in December while in 16th place and eventually failed to qualify for European football for the first time in two decades. Eden Hazard, the previous season\\'s PFA Players\\' Player of the Year, did not score a league goal until late April.[14] They eventually finished 10th, breaking the record for lowest finish for a Premier League title holder - 7th - held jointly by Blackburn Rovers in 1995–96 and Manchester United in 2013–14.[15] This record only stood for one year, as Leicester City finished 12th the following season.\\nArsenal, looking for their first title since 2004 and following a poor start, improved and in early January took the top spot from Leicester. However, a poor run of results, including draws with Liverpool,[16] Stoke City[17] and Southampton,[18] and a loss to Chelsea[19] saw them drop to fourth by mid-February. They remained in contention, but draws with West Ham United, Sunderland and Crystal Palace in April saw their title hopes vanish.[20][21][22]\\nMeanwhile, Arsenal\\'s London rivals Tottenham Hotspur won six matches in a row, and when Arsenal lost to Manchester United at the end of February, Tottenham leapfrogged them into second place,[23] where they remained until the final weekend of the season. Draws with West Bromwich Albion[24] and Chelsea prevented them from winning their first league title since 1961. The game in which Tottenham\\'s title challenge ended was their 2–2 draw at Chelsea on 2 May, with many altercations between players and benches on and off the field, especially after Eden Hazard scored the equalizing and final goal.[25] Mark Clattenburg, who refereed the game, subsequently stated that he could have \"sent three players off from Tottenham\" but chose instead to allow them to play on, giving the team a total of nine yellow cards (a league record), so as to allow them to \"self destruct\" and have no one else to blame but themselves.[26][27]\\nAfter a 2–1 home loss to Southampton and a 5–1 defeat away to Newcastle United in their final two matches, Tottenham ended the season in third place, one point behind Arsenal.[28]\\nWest Ham United, in their final season at the Boleyn Ground after 112 years, achieved 62 points, a club record for a Premier League campaign. It was also the first Premier League season where they had finished with a positive goal difference (+14) and West Ham\\'s eight defeats was also a club record for the fewest losses suffered in a Premier League season. \\nAston Villa, a presence in the Premier League since the league\\'s foundation in 1992 and present in the top division since the 1988–89 season, were the first team to be mathematically relegated, after a 1–0 loss at Manchester United on 16 April.[29] On 11 May, Sunderland won 3–0 against Everton, a result which relegated both Newcastle United and Norwich City with one game remaining.[30]\\nAll of the final fixtures of the season were scheduled for 15 May and were to kick off at the same time. However, Manchester United\\'s home game against Bournemouth was postponed to two days later after Old Trafford was evacuated because of the discovery of a suspicious device, which was destroyed in a controlled explosion. It was confirmed to be an accidental leftover from a training exercise.[31]\\nThe unlikely nature of Leicester\\'s title led to a flood of coverage from across the globe. Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted his congratulations, saying it was \"An extraordinary, thoroughly deserved, Premier League title.\" Congratulations were also sent by the Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who praised his compatriot Ranieri.[32]\\nPremier League chief executive Richard Scudamore described it as \"biggest story we\\'ve ever had\" in English football.[33] Former Leicester manager Martin O\\'Neill described it as the \"greatest achievement of this century\".[33] Gary Lineker, the former Leicester striker who led a consortium that saved the club from administration in 2002, had said he would host the BBC football show Match of the Day in his underwear if Leicester won the title. After they won the title, he did indeed present the show clad only in boxer shorts.[34] He said: \"There were no odds that I would have taken at the start of the season. No odds. You could have given me 10 million to one and I\\'d have said \\'Nah, it\\'s a waste of a quid\\'\".[35] José Mourinho, manager of 2015 champions Chelsea and Ranieri\\'s replacement at the same team eleven years earlier, sent his congratulations, saying: \"I lost my title to Claudio Ranieri and it is with incredible emotion that I live this magic moment in his career.\"[36]\\nRanieri said after winning his first title at the age of 64 that he wouldn\\'t have appreciated it as a young man: \"Now I am an old man I can feel it much better.\"[36][37]\\nThe long odds bookmakers had given Leicester at the start of the season led to them incurring losses of up to £25 million, with one punter winning over £100,000, having wagered £20 at the original 5,000–1 odds;[38] the largest payout was £200,000 to an anonymous bettor who wagered £100 on the team in October when the odds were improved to 2,000–1.[39]\\nSuperstitious claims of phenomena helping Leicester win the league include the club\\'s Thai owners engaging Buddhist monks to bless the players,[32] and the reburial of King Richard III in the city\\'s cathedral in March 2015.[40]\\nTwenty teams competed in the league\\xa0– the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams were Bournemouth (playing in the top flight for the first time ever), Watford (returning to the top flight after eight years) and Norwich City (returning after a season\\'s absence). They replaced Hull City (ending their two-year spell in the top flight), Burnley and Queens Park Rangers (both teams relegated after a season\\'s presence).\\n4 Player scored 4 goals5 Player scored 5 goals(H) – Home team(A) – Away team\\n',\n",
       " \"2016–17 Premier League\\nThe 2016–17 Premier League was the 25th season of the Premier League, the top English professional league for association football clubs, since its establishment in 1992, and the 118th season of top-flight English football overall. The season began on 13 August 2016 and concluded on 21 May 2017.[4] Fixtures for the 2016–17 season were announced on 15 June 2016.[5]\\nChelsea won their fifth Premier League title, and sixth English title, with two matches to spare following a 1–0 away win over West Bromwich Albion on 12 May.[6]\\nThe defending champions were Leicester City, who finished 12th, thereby setting a new record for the worst Premier League title defence; the record had previously been held by Chelsea, who had finished 10th in 2015–16 after winning the title in 2014–15. When including the Football League era, it was the worst title defence since 1991–92 champions Leeds United finished 17th in 1992–93.[7]\\nBurnley, Middlesbrough and Hull City entered as the three promoted teams from the 2015–16 Football League Championship.\\nOn 9 February 2016, the Premier League announced a rebrand; beginning with the 2016–17 season, the competition was known simply as the Premier League, without any sponsor's name attached. As part of the rebranding, a new logo was introduced.[8]\\nFrom the beginning of the 2016–17 season, ticket prices for away fans were capped at £30 per ticket.[9]\\nAntonio Conte enjoyed a successful start as Chelsea manager, winning the title in his first season at the club and earning a record number of league victories for a season, with only poor early form preventing them from also setting a new points total. Tottenham Hotspur shrugged off a disappointing Champions League campaign to push Chelsea close for the title, though they ultimately missed out. However, they finished the season with statistically both the best attack and defence, with striker Harry Kane once again claiming the Golden Boot. Furthermore, the season marked the end of Tottenham's 118-year stay at the White Hart Lane stadium, temporarily using Wembley for the subsequent season, before a new stadium move.[10] Manchester City finished one spot better than the previous season in Pep Guardiola's first season in charge, though ended the season trophy-less, despite recording the third-best attack and reaching the semi-finals of the FA Cup. Liverpool made the Champions League for the first time in three years in Jürgen Klopp's first full season, though they were prevented from finishing any higher than fourth by an inconsistent start to 2017, a consequence of both losing their £35\\xa0million signing Sadio Mané to international duty in January and February as well as suffering from several dropped points against bottom-half teams.\\nDespite winning seven of their final eight games, Arsenal finished fifth and failed to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 1997, as fan pressure on both manager Arsène Wenger and majority-shareholder Stan Kroenke grew. While they did win the FA Cup for the third time in four seasons, making Wenger the most successful manager in the competition's history, they endured yet another disappointing Champions League run, eliminated at the round of 16 for a seventh successive year. Manchester United finished sixth, one lower than the previous season, in José Mourinho's first season in charge, with their failure to turn any one of their 15 draws – with 12 earned amidst the season-record 25 matches unbeaten run – into victories proving problematic. They did at least win the EFL Cup and won the Europa League final. The latter was the first Europa League title in their history, not only securing a place in the Champions League but also made them only the fifth club to have won all three major European trophies. Everton, the final team to qualify for the UEFA competitions, made their first return to that level for 3 years. Under Ronald Koeman, who replaced Roberto Martínez following his sacking towards the end of the previous season after a period of mid-table stagnation, the club would spend virtually the entire season in the Europa League places; never mounting any serious push for the Champions League places, but always remaining well clear of the rest of the league. This also meant that for the fourth time in seven seasons, the top seven positions were occupied by the same teams.\\nIn only their second-ever top-flight season, AFC Bournemouth built on the success of the previous season as they secured a ninth-place finish and scored 55 goals, defying the critics who had tipped them to struggle from second-season syndrome. Much as Chelsea had the previous season, Leicester City made a poor defence of their title, despite having what turned out to be the best Champions League run of any English club this season. They were beaten by Hull City in the first match, the first time this has happened to a reigning Premier League champion. With the club struggling, manager Claudio Ranieri was sacked in February and replaced by coach Craig Shakespeare, who steered the club to 12th. It broke the record of the lowest finish for Premier League title holders, set by Chelsea the previous season by finishing 10th, but comfortably clear of relegation.\\nSwansea City had looked dead and buried after early struggles under Francesco Guidolin and then a disastrous spell with Bob Bradley as manager, but were saved by a late improvement under Paul Clement's management. Burnley fared the best of the promoted clubs, with only atrocious away form preventing them finishing higher as they made their home-ground of Turf Moor one of the hardest places to get a point from – and secured a second successive top-flight season for the first time in 40 years. Watford, in their first successive top-flight campaign for 30 years, successfully ensured a third consecutive Premier League season – however, as a result of poor away form, a disastrous end to the season and several spells of indifferent form throughout the campaign, the Hornets were unable to really build on the previous season despite recording their first league victories over Manchester United and at Arsenal since the 1980s.\\nAfter several successive escapes from relegation, Sunderland's resilience finally broke and they dropped into the Championship after a decade, having spent virtually the entire season rooted to the bottom of the table. Middlesbrough also struggled through their first top-flight season in eight years, with a poor end to the season, the weakest goal-scoring record in the division and an inability to turn one of their 13 draws into victories dooming them. Hull City were the final relegated side, never quite recovering from a disastrous pre-season which saw manager Steve Bruce quit and next to no new players signed. Despite encouraging early season form under Mike Phelan, a dismal run in the winter saw him sacked and replaced by Marco Silva, who steered the club to a much better second half of the season, but it ultimately proved to be a case of too little, too late.\\nTwenty teams competed in the league\\xa0– the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams were Burnley, Middlesbrough and Hull City. Burnley and Hull City returned to the top flight after a season's absence while Middlesbrough returned after a seven-year absence. They replaced Newcastle United, Norwich City and Aston Villa, ending their top flight spells of six, one and twenty-eight years respectively.\\n4 Player scored 4 goals(H) – Home team(A) – Away team\\n\",\n",
       " '2017–18 Premier League\\nThe 2017–18 Premier League was the 26th season of the Premier League, the top English professional league for association football clubs, since its establishment in 1992, and the 119th season of top-flight English football overall. The season started on 11 August 2017 and concluded on 13 May 2018. Fixtures for the 2017–18 season were announced on 14 June 2017.[3] Chelsea were the defending champions, while Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and Huddersfield Town entered as the promoted teams from the 2016–17 EFL Championship.\\nManchester City won their third Premier League title, and fifth English top-flight title overall, with five games to spare.[4] The team broke numerous Premier League records over the course of the season, including: most points (100), most wins (32), most away wins (16), most goals (106), most consecutive league wins (18), highest goal difference (+79), fewest minutes behind in matches (153 minutes) and biggest winning points margin (19).[5][6] All three promoted clubs avoided relegation for the first time since the 2011–12 campaign, and for only the third time in Premier League history.\\nFrom this season on, club strips could feature sleeve sponsorship, whereby sponsors\\' logos would appear on the left sleeve of the strip in lieu of the Premier League patch.[7][8][9]\\nFrom this season on, a three-man panel consisting of a former player, a former manager and a former match official would independently review video evidence on the Monday after games. Any player whom the three-man panel unanimously decided had caused an opponent to be sent off or had won a penalty as a result of deceiving the referee by simulation would be charged by the Football Association with \"Successful Deception of a Match Official\" which carried a penalty of suspension for two matches. Everton striker Oumar Niasse became the first Premier League player to be punished under the new rule.[10]\\nManchester City were confirmed as Premier League champions following Manchester United\\'s 0–1 defeat at home to West Bromwich Albion in the 33rd round. Manchester City had started the Premier League season with an away win over Brighton & Hove Albion in August. After a draw against Everton, Manchester City won eighteen games in a row. During this time they secured first position and held it for the remainder of the season. On 7 April, Manchester City hosted Manchester United in the local derby, in which a win would have secured their position as champions. United came back from 2-0 down at half-time to win 3-2 and deny their rivals the title; however, the following week they lost to bottom club West Bromwich Albion, a result which, coupled with Manchester City\\'s victory over Tottenham Hotspur, ensured an unassailable lead with five games left.[11]\\nDuring the campaign Manchester City broke and set several new club and English football records. They established national records in consecutive away (11) and overall (20) victories in all competitions; set a new English record for consecutive league wins (18); equalled the Premier League record for consecutive away league wins (11) and set club records by achieving 28 consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions; 30 consecutive games unbeaten in the league; 20 consecutive home wins in all competitions; and winning 14 away games in a season.[12][13][14][15] They won their fifth English league title, and completed their second league and League Cup double in four years.\\nDefending champions Chelsea started the season badly, losing their opening game to Burnley 2–3; the first time the holders were defeated at home in their first match. A win at one of the title favourites, Tottenham, in their second game seemed to get their defence back on track, but results in September, including losing 0–1 to Manchester City, left them six points behind the leaders in fourth place. They failed to show the consistency of the previous season, and finished in fifth place, leading to Antonio Conte\\'s dismissal as manager a year after leading them to the title. \\nManchester United started the season strongly winning their first three games without conceding a goal and led the table until mid-September. They finished in 2nd, their highest finish and points total (81) since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson. \\nLiverpool finished fourth for a second consecutive season, buoyed by the signing of Mohamed Salah; his 32 goals broke a Premier League record for most goals scored in a 38-game season, beating the 31 achieved by Cristiano Ronaldo, Alan Shearer and Luis Suarez.\\nArsenal had a poor season, finishing sixth overall. Long-serving manager Arsène Wenger announced his departure from the club on 20 April 2018.[16] Their final home game was an emphatic 5–0 defeat of Burnley which guaranteed qualification to the group stage of the Europa League.[17]\\nDespite the defeat, Burnley finished in seventh place, their best finish in English football since 1973–74. This meant they would be entered into the second qualifying round of the Europa League, their first competitive European football campaign in 50 years.[18] Their strong finish led to manager Sean Dyche and defender James Tarkowski being nominated for the Premier League Manager of the Season and Premier League Player of the Season awards respectively.[19]\\nStoke City were the first team to be relegated to the EFL Championship when they lost 1–2 to Crystal Palace in their penultimate game. Although Stoke were only three points from safety with one game remaining, fellow strugglers Swansea and Southampton still had to play each other, meaning that Stoke would be unable to catch both of those teams and finish fourth from bottom.[20] The game between Swansea and Southampton ended in a 1–0 away win for Southampton, which also meant that despite a five-game unbeaten run, West Bromwich Albion became the second team to be relegated to the Championship on 8 May 2018.[21] Following their 1–2 defeat at the hands of Stoke on the final matchday, Swansea City were also relegated.[22] This meant that all three promoted teams, Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and Huddersfield Town, survived relegation for the first time since the 2011-12 campaign. \\nTwenty teams competed in the league\\xa0– the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams were Newcastle United, Brighton & Hove Albion and Huddersfield Town, returning to the top flight after an absence of one, thirty-four and forty-five years respectively. This was also both Brighton & Hove Albion and Huddersfield Town\\'s first season in the Premier League. They replaced Hull City, Middlesbrough (both teams relegated after a season\\'s presence) and Sunderland (relegated after ten years in the top flight).\\n\\n4 Player scored 4 goals(H) – Home team(A) – Away team\\nSource: World FootballNotes:1: Team played last season in the Championship\\n',\n",
       " \"2018–19 Premier League\\nThe 2018–19 Premier League was the 27th season of the Premier League, the top English professional league for association football clubs, since its establishment in 1992, and the 120th season of top-flight English football overall. The season started on 10 August 2018 and concluded on 12 May 2019.[2][3] Fixtures for the 2018–19 season were announced on 14 June 2018. The league was contested by the top 17 teams from the 2017–18 season as well as Wolverhampton Wanderers, Cardiff City and Fulham, who joined as the promoted clubs from the 2017–18 EFL Championship. They replaced West Bromwich Albion, Swansea City and Stoke City who were relegated to the 2018–19 EFL Championship.[4]\\nDefending champions Manchester City won their fourth Premier League title, and sixth English top-flight title overall. They won their last 14 league games and retained the league title on the final day of the season, finishing on 98 points. Liverpool finished runners-up with 97 points – the highest total in English top-flight history for a second-placed team.\\nManchester City claimed the league title on the final day of the season with a 4–1 win at Brighton & Hove Albion, finishing on 98 points after a run of 14 wins.[5] Liverpool held a 7-point lead over Manchester City on 3 January,[6] but finished runners-up with 97 points – the third highest total in Premier League history and the highest in English top-flight history for a second-placed team, having lost only one league match all season – to eventual champions City.[7]\\nChelsea and Tottenham Hotspur claimed the other two Champions League berths, finishing in third and fourth place respectively. Tottenham were in third place for much of the season and were considered potential title challengers until a 1–2 loss to Burnley in February.[8] Chelsea would go on to win the season's UEFA Europa League, defeating Arsenal in the final 4–1. Arsenal had gone on a fourteen-game unbeaten run near the start of the season and began April in third place, but a run of four points in six matches saw them drop to fifth place, finishing outside of the Champions League spots.[9]\\nManchester United's worst start to the season for 28 years led to the sacking of manager José Mourinho in December,[10] with former player Ole Gunnar Solskjær replacing him, initially as a caretaker. Solskjær was appointed permanently after an impressive run of results which culminated in United's away goals victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Champions League,[11] but the team's poor form soon returned, and they eventually finished sixth after the team had won none of their final five league matches.[12] Newly promoted Wolverhampton Wanderers achieved their highest finish since 1980 by finishing seventh, having taken points off every team in the league except Liverpool and Huddersfield Town.[13] Their seventh-place finish was the highest for a newly promoted team since Ipswich Town finished 5th in the 2000–01 season.[14]\\nHuddersfield were the first team to be relegated, following their 0–2 defeat at Crystal Palace on 30 March 2019, coinciding with victories for Burnley and Southampton. They were relegated with six games remaining. This made Huddersfield the second team in Premier League history to be relegated before March ended, following Derby County in 2007–08.[15] Fulham joined them after a 1–4 defeat at Watford on 2 April, relegated with five games remaining.[16] Cardiff City were the final team to be relegated following a 2–3 loss at home to Crystal Palace on 4 May with one game remaining.[17]\\nThe fastest goal in Premier League history was scored this season on 23 April by Shane Long in a 1–1 draw between his side Southampton and Watford after 7.69 seconds.[18][19] On 4 May 2019, Fulham's Harvey Elliott became the youngest ever Premier League player at 16 years and 30 days.[20] Tottenham Hotspur had a run of 28 games without a draw, the longest ever recorded from the start of a Premier League season.[21] Manchester City did not draw any of their final 30 matches. \\nThe season saw two aviation incidents involving Premier League personnel. On 27 October 2018, Leicester City owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha was killed in a helicopter crash outside the King Power Stadium, shortly after a 1–1 home draw against West Ham United. Almost three months later, on 21 January 2019, Cardiff City player Emiliano Sala, en route to join the club following his record signing from Nantes, died on board a Piper PA-46 Malibu aircraft that crashed off Alderney.[22]\\nTwenty teams competed in the league\\xa0– the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams were Wolverhampton Wanderers (returning to the top flight after a six-year absence), Cardiff City and Fulham (both teams returning after a four-year absence). They replaced Swansea City, Stoke City and West Bromwich Albion, ending their top flight spells of seven, ten and eight years respectively.\\nMatch balls supplied by Nike, this season's version is the Merlin.\\n(H) – Home team(A) – Away team\\nUpdated to games played on 1 December 2019Source: World FootballNotes:1: Team played last season in the Championship\\n\",\n",
       " '2019–20 Premier League\\nThe 2019–20 Premier League was the 28th season of the Premier League, the top English professional football league, since its establishment in 1992, and the 121st season of top-flight English football overall. The season started on 9 August 2019 and concluded on 26 July 2020.[5] Manchester City were the defending champions for the second successive year, after picking up the domestic treble the previous season. Liverpool won their first league title since 1990, the club\\'s first of the Premier League era and nineteenth overall.\\nOver the season, Liverpool set a number of English top-flight records including the earliest title win (with seven games to spare),[6] the biggest points lead at any time (25),[7] and the most consecutive home wins (24, of which 7 were carried over from the previous season).[7]\\nThe season was halted for over three months, following a decision on 13 March 2020 by the Premier League to suspend the league after a number of players and other club staff became ill due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The initial suspension, until 4 April, was then extended to mid-June.[3] The season recommenced with two matches on 17 June and a full round of matches played over the weekend of 19–22 June.[8]\\nIn 2019–20, the video assistant referee (VAR) review system was introduced.[9] Changes to the laws affecting backpasses, penalties, handballs and substitutions were also introduced in 2019–20.[10]\\nThe Premier League season marked the start of a new three-year TV deal. One key change was that eight matches were shown on television at 19:45 on Saturdays across the season, broadcast by Sky Sports.[11] Further, Amazon broadcast two rounds of fixtures in December, including the Merseyside derby, marking the first time an entire round of live matches had been broadcast domestically.[12]\\nIt was the first Premier League season to have a mid-season break in February. Three games of a normal round of ten were played on the weekend 8–9 February 2020, six games on the following weekend 14–17 February and the tenth game, Manchester City versus West Ham United, was rescheduled from 9 February to 19 February due to Storm Ciara. Games played on the same day had separate time slots such that the games did not overlap.[13]\\nWith Manchester City and Liverpool achieving 98 and 97 points respectively in the 2018–19 season, many expected another close race for the title. Liverpool started the season in strong form with eight consecutive wins, while City suffered shock defeats to newly promoted Norwich City and Wolverhampton Wanderers.[14]  Liverpool\\'s 3–1 win over City at Anfield in November opened up an 8-point lead at the top of the table and they maintained their lead for the remainder of the season.  \\nOn 25 June 2020, Manchester City lost 2–1 to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, mathematically confirming Liverpool as champions and marking their first league title in 30 years, and their first of the Premier League era.[15]\\nUpon winning the league, Liverpool claimed the unusual achievement of winning the Premier League earlier than any other team by games played (with seven games remaining) and later than any other team by date (the only team to clinch the title in the month of June).[16]\\nOn 25 October 2019, Leicester City broke the Premier League record – as well as the all-time English top-flight record – for the largest away league win and equalled the biggest ever Premier League win when they defeated Southampton 9–0 at St Mary\\'s Stadium.[17]\\nDuring the season, Liverpool broke or tied several Premier League all-time records. They achieved a record-equalling 18 consecutive wins[18] before being defeated by Watford on 29 February. They also set records of 24 consecutive home wins,[7] and a 25-point lead in the table at any time.[7]\\nOn 12 January 2020, in a 6–1 victory over Aston Villa, Manchester City\\'s Sergio Agüero broke Thierry Henry\\'s Premier League record for most goals scored by an overseas player.[19] In the same match, he also broke the record for most hat-tricks scored by a single player (12), previously held by Alan Shearer.[20]\\nAs a gesture of solidarity following the murder of George Floyd, players\\' names on the back of their shirts were replaced with \\'Black Lives Matter\\' for the first 12 matches of the restarted season as well as replacing the Premier League badge for the BLM\\'s for the rest of the season. The Premier League also gave their support for any player who chooses to \"take a knee\" before or during matches.[21] In addition, the NHS tribute badge was also used at all kits for the remainder of the season.\\nOn 11 July 2020, Norwich City became the first team to be relegated to the Championship after a 4–0 defeat at home to West Ham United with three games remaining.[22] On 26 July 2020, Bournemouth were the second team to be relegated to the Championship on the final day of the season, despite winning 3–1 away to Everton.[23] Watford were the final team to be relegated to the Championship after losing 3–2 away to Arsenal on the same day.[24] Both of these results were coupled with Aston Villa\\'s 1–1 draw against West Ham United, ensuring Aston Villa safety in the Premier League for another season.[25] Coincidentally, the three relegated teams were the same teams promoted to the Premier League for the 2015–16 season.\\nSince March, the season was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.[26] On 10 March, the match between Manchester City and Arsenal, due to be played the next day after being rescheduled due to City\\'s participation in the 2020 EFL Cup Final, was postponed. A number of Arsenal players had made close contact with Olympiacos owner Evangelos Marinakis, who had tested positive for infection with the coronavirus, when the two teams had met in the Europa League 13 days earlier.[27] It is the first football season in England to be halted since the 1939–40 season was abandoned after only three games following the outbreak of the Second World War.[28]\\nOn 12 March, it was revealed that three Leicester City players were self-isolating.[29] Manchester City announced that their defender Benjamin Mendy was also self-isolating, after a family member displayed symptoms of the virus.[30] Later in the evening, it was then confirmed that Arsenal head coach Mikel Arteta had tested positive for coronavirus.[31] As a result of Arteta\\'s positive test, the match between Brighton & Hove Albion and Arsenal, scheduled for 14 March at the Amex, was postponed.[32] On 13 March, Chelsea announced that their winger Callum Hudson-Odoi had tested positive for coronavirus.[33]\\nOn 13 March, following an emergency meeting between the Premier League, The Football Association (FA), the English Football League and the FA Women\\'s Super League, it was unanimously decided to suspend professional football in England until at least 4 April 2020.[2] On 19 March, the suspension was extended to at least 30 April 2020.[34] At the same time the FA agreed to extend the season indefinitely, past the scheduled end date of 1 June. In April 2020, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, called on Premier League players to take a pay cut during the pandemic.[35] The PFA rejected the call as they felt that a cut for all players would impact the Exchequer with a loss of income tax revenue.[36] Several clubs, including Watford, Southampton and West Ham United, all agreed to defer their wages.[37] Later in April, the Premier League produced a plan, nicknamed \"Project Restart\", aimed at restarting the league and playing all 92 remaining matches over a six-week period at approved, neutral stadiums.[38] Watford, Aston Villa and Brighton, all near the bottom of the table, were of the opinion that it would be unfair to play the games in such different conditions when at risk of relegation but would be more in favour if the threat of relegation was removed.[39][40] From 19 May 2020, players were allowed to return to group training in preparation for restarting the league. They were permitted to be in groups of no more than five with all training sessions lasting no longer than 75 minutes for each player. Social distancing rules must be adhered to during the sessions.[41]\\nOn 17 and 18 May, a total of 748 players and staff were tested for COVID-19. Six tests proved positive including Adrian Mariappa of Watford and Burnley assistant manager, Ian Woan.[42][43][44]\\nLater in May, Aaron Ramsdale of Bournemouth also returned a positive test for the virus.[45]\\nA number of players, including Manchester City\\'s Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero and Aaron Cresswell of West Ham United, voiced concerns relating to the safety of restarting the campaign. Danny Rose of Newcastle United called the decision to restart \"a joke\".[46][47] Troy Deeney of Watford said he would not return to training because of fear for his family\\'s health.[48] N\\'Golo Kanté of Chelsea also missed training with safety concerns.[49] On 27 May, the clubs voted unanimously to resume contact training.[50] Aston Villa\\'s Tyrone Mings said the players had not been consulted regarding restarting the league and that the restart was \"financially driven\".[51]\\nOn 28 May, clubs agreed that the season would restart on 17 June,[52] with the two games in hand of Manchester City vs Arsenal and Aston Villa vs Sheffield United,[53] with the first full round of fixtures since March to be played on the weekend of 19–21 June, with all matches played behind closed doors.  A plan was announced for all remaining matches to be televised, and to widen the availability of domestic broadcasts: for the first time, the BBC gained rights to broadcast four live matches on free-to-air television, while Sky announced plans to carry 25 matches on its free-to-air channel Pick.[54] Amazon were allotted four matches. and announced it would provide a means of streaming them for free without an Amazon Prime subscription; on 18 June it was announced that these matches would be carried on its video game live streaming service Twitch.[55][56]\\nOn 4 June, the Premier League announced that teams would be allowed to name nine substitutes per match, instead of the usual seven, and that teams could use five substitutes per match instead of three.[57]\\nAston Villa vs. Sheffield United and Manchester City vs. Arsenal on 17 June were the first games played after the pandemic enforced break.[58]\\nFinancial services company Deloitte estimated that Premier League clubs would face a £1\\xa0billion loss of revenue for the 2019–20 season, £500\\xa0million being accounted for in rebates to broadcasters and loss of matchday revenue.[59]\\nFurther tests for the virus were carried out on 11 and 12 June. Two unnamed people provided a positive result including one player from Norwich City who would be required to self-isolate thereby missing the first fixture of the restarted season. Following these tests there had been 16 positive results from 8,687 tests.[60]\\nBefore the restart of games the Premier League produced a set of guidelines to be followed at all games. They stipulated that all matches must be played behind closed doors, with the number of key people allowed inside the stadium limited to 300. All stadiums are divided into three zones — red (includes pitch and technical areas), amber (stands) and green (stand concourses) — and there are restrictions on who is allowed to enter each. There is staggered entry on to the pitch for players and staff and no handshakes are allowed before kick-off. Deep cleaning of corner flags, goalposts, substitution boards and match balls takes place before and after each fixture as standard. Extra disinfection, such as of the substitution board after it is used, is likely during matches and at half-time. Additional measures include that players and coaching staff must observe social distancing rules when travelling to and from games, and post-match broadcast interviews must take place pitchside with press conferences conducted virtually.[61]\\nTwenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams were Norwich City, Sheffield United and Aston Villa. Norwich City and Aston Villa returned to the top flight after absences of three years, while Sheffield United returned after a twelve-year absence. They replaced Cardiff City, Fulham (both teams relegated after one season back in the top flight) and Huddersfield Town (relegated after two years in the top flight). Cardiff City\\'s relegation means that this season was the first without a side from Wales since the 2010–11 season.\\n4 Player scored 4 goals(H) – Home team(A) – Away team\\n',\n",
       " \"2020–21 Premier League\\nThe 2020–21 Premier League was the 29th season of the Premier League, the top English professional league for association football clubs since its establishment in 1992 and the 122nd season of top-flight English football overall. The season was initially scheduled to start on 8 August 2020 and end on 16 May 2021,[2] but this was delayed until 12 September as a consequence of the postponement of the previous season's conclusion due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[3] Liverpool were the defending champions, having won their first Premier League and nineteenth English league title the previous season. \\nIn a season largely played behind closed doors, Manchester City secured a fifth Premier League title and seventh English league title overall with three matches to spare; it was also the club's third title in the last four seasons.[4]\\nAt the start of this season, as was the case at the end of the previous season, there was limited or no attendance at matches besides each team's staff and personnel.[5] On 23 November 2020, it was announced that some fans would be allowed to return to stadiums in low-risk areas at the end of the second national lockdown on 2 December 2020.[6] The announcement of a third national lockdown on 4 January 2021, though, signalled a return to matches being played behind closed doors.[7]\\nOn 22 February 2021, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced as the third step of recovery from the lockdown imposed on 4 January, that subject to certain criteria being met on vaccines, infection rates and new coronavirus variants, large football stadiums would be allowed to reopen on 17 May with a maximum of 10,000 spectators or 25% capacity, whichever was higher.[8] This meant that the final round of fixtures scheduled for the 23 May would see spectators return to the stadium. To ensure all clubs played their final home game in front of fans, the penultimate round of fixtures were rearranged to take place on 18–19 May. No away fans were permitted for these matches.[9]\\nThe 2020–21 season began on Saturday 12 September, just seven weeks after the conclusion of the 2019–20 season.[10] Liverpool were the defending champions, having won their nineteenth league title the previous season, their first in the Premier League era.[2] As originally planned, the 2020–21 season was to be the second Premier League season with a mid-season break in February, whereby five games of a normal round of ten would be played on one weekend and the remaining five the following weekend.[11] However, due to the late start of the league and fixture congestion, the winter break was scrapped.[12] It is also the second Premier League season to use VAR (Video Assistant Referee).[13]\\nThe top of the table was tight for the first months of the season, with Arsenal, Leicester City, Everton, Liverpool and Southampton all having occupied first position by early November.[14] The top six were separated by only three points at that stage.[15] Tottenham Hotspur became the sixth different leader later that month,[16] but Liverpool overtook them again mid-December, following a meeting between the two clubs at Anfield which resulted in a 2–1 win to Liverpool.[17] By Christmas, Liverpool had opened up a five-point gap following a 7–0 away win against Crystal Palace.[18]\\nIn the new year, Liverpool suffered from a significant slump in form, dropping to 8th place by early March.[19] They suffered their first home defeat in 69 games with a 1–0 defeat to Burnley,[20] which began a run of six consecutive losses at Anfield, following losses to Brighton & Hove Albion, Manchester City, Everton, Chelsea and Fulham.[19] Manchester United took the lead at the top of the table in mid-January with a 1–0 away win against Burnley,[21] but they were in turn replaced by Manchester City at the end of the month as a 5–0 Manchester City win over West Bromwich Albion was followed by a 2–1 home defeat for Manchester United against Sheffield United.[22][23]\\nThis was to prove the final change of team at the top, as Manchester City went on a 15-match winning streak which saw them 15 points clear of second-place Manchester United after a 4–1 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 2 March.[24] They went on to secure the title on 12 May 2021 with three matches to spare, following a home defeat for Manchester United against Leicester. It was the club's fifth Premier League title and seventh English league title overall, as well as their third title in the past four seasons.[25]\\nThe remaining two slots for Champions League qualification were taken by Liverpool and Chelsea. Although Liverpool were 8th with ten games remaining, a run of eight wins from their final ten games, including a 95th-minute winner scored by goalkeeper Alisson against West Bromwich Albion, saw them recover their position to finish 3rd and qualify for a fifth straight season.[26] Chelsea endured a difficult start to the season under Frank Lampard, who was sacked in January with the club in 9th position and replaced by Thomas Tuchel. The club's form improved under Tuchel to secure a second consecutive finish in 4th place, despite a final day defeat to Aston Villa.[27] They won in that season's Champions League final the next week, in the competition's third all-English final against champions Manchester City.\\nLeicester enjoyed a successful season, spending more time in the top four places than any other club; however, three defeats in their final four games, including a home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on the final day, saw them narrowly finish in 5th for a second consecutive season.[28] Having narrowly avoiding relegation the previous season, West Ham United surprised many by finishing 6th, their highest finish since 1998–99.[29] Both these clubs earned qualification to the Europa League for the following season.\\nDespite leading the table in November, Tottenham suffered a string of poor results from December onwards. Manager Jose Mourinho was sacked in April with the club in 7th place, with Ryan Mason taking over as interim manager for the rest of the season. Mason was unable to improve the club's position and they finished 7th, their lowest finish since the 2008–09 season, but still good enough to qualify for the brand new third tier Europa Conference League competition.[citation needed] Meanwhile, their traditional North London rivals Arsenal endured an even worse campaign; eight defeats in their first 14 games left them in 15th just before Christmas and seemingly in danger of being sucked into a relegation battle. Whilst they would pick up enough points thereafter to pull away from the bottom half of the table, the Gunners could only finish 8th for a second successive season; they failed to qualify for European competition for the first time since the 1994–95 season.\\nOn 17 April 2021, Sheffield United were confirmed to be the first team to be relegated to the Championship following a 1–0 defeat away to Wolverhampton Wanderers with six games remaining, ending their two-year top flight tenure. [30] On 9 May 2021, West Bromwich Albion became the second team to be relegated following a 3–1 defeat away to Arsenal, with three games remaining, immediately returning to the Championship after a season's presence in the top flight.[31] On 10 May 2021, Fulham were the third and final team to be relegated following a 2–0 defeat at home against Burnley with three games remaining, also immediately returning to the Championship after a season's presence in the top flight. This also marked the first time in the Premier League era that all three teams have been relegated with more than two games to spare.[32] In contrast, the final promoted team, Leeds United, finished in 9th with 59 points, the highest points tally for a newly promoted side since Ipswich Town in 2000–01 (66 points).[citation needed]\\nTwenty teams compete in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams are Leeds United, West Bromwich Albion and Fulham, after respective top flight absences of sixteen, two and one year(s). They replaced Bournemouth, Watford (both teams relegated after five years in the top flight), and Norwich City (relegated after only a year back in the top flight).\\n4 Player scored 4 goals(H) – Home team(A) – Away team\\n\",\n",
       " '2021–22 Premier League\\nThe 2021–22 Premier League was the 30th season of the Premier League, the top English professional league for association football clubs since its establishment in 1992, and the 123rd season of top-flight English football overall. The start and end dates for the season were released on 25 March 2021,[2] and the fixtures were released on 16 June 2021.[3][4]\\nManchester City successfully defended their title, securing a sixth Premier League title and eighth English league title overall on the final day of the season; it was also the club\\'s fourth title in the last five seasons.[5]\\nManchester City were the defending champions, having won their fifth Premier League title during the previous season.\\nThis season saw the return of full attendance, after the final third of the 2019–20 and the entirety of the 2020–21 seasons were held with limited or no attendance due to the restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.[6] This season was the second season to feature a winter break, with no Premier League matches scheduled between 23 January and 7 February 2022.[7]\\nThe early title race was dominated by Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea, who were separated by two points by early December. By December, Chelsea led the way following a run of just one defeat in 14 matches until a shock defeat to West Ham United gave City the edge.[8] A run of 12 consecutive victories, concluding in a victory over Chelsea that essentially ended their title hopes, gave Manchester City a 13 point lead by January (though Liverpool had two games in hand due to COVID-19 postponements).[9] Liverpool then went on a 10 game winning run, including both their games in hand, to cut City\\'s lead to a single point ahead of their meeting at the Etihad on 10 April. A 2-2 draw retained City\\'s narrow lead going into the final weeks of the season.[10]\\nOn 7 October, Saudi Arabia\\'s Public Investment Fund purchased an 80% stake and completed the £300m takeover of Newcastle United, ending the 14 year ownership of Mike Ashley. On 12 October 2021, an emergency meeting was convened by the other 19 Premier League clubs between themselves and the Premier League, where they voiced their anger at the league\\'s decision to ratify the takeover; Newcastle United were the only Premier League club to be excluded from attending the meeting.[11] On 18 November 2021, Premier League clubs voted to tighten the Premier League\\'s financial controls in order to limit Newcastle United\\'s spending power.[12]\\nAt the time of the takeover, Newcastle were in 19th position having failed to win any of their first seven games.[13] The new ownership sacked Steve Bruce and hired Eddie Howe; while Newcastle did not win a game until the 15th attempt, their form improved dramatically after five signings in the January transfer window.[citation needed] A run of 12 wins in their final 18 games secured an 11th place finish.[14]\\nIn December 2021, multiple matches were postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreaks in multiple clubs, with many clubs calling for the league to shut down until 2022.[15] Following a meeting on 20 December involving all 20 Premier League clubs, a decision was made to fulfil the fixtures over the Christmas period \"where it is safe to do so\". Clubs were advised that if they had 13 fit players, plus a goalkeeper, then they should fulfil their fixtures.[16]\\nOn 2 March, Roman Abramovich announced that he planned to sell Chelsea, stating his intent to donate all proceeds of the sale to the victims of the war in Ukraine.[17] In the following days, numerous reports about interested buyers surfaced including Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss, Los Angeles Dodgers and Lakers shareholder Todd Boehly, Pakistani businessman Javed Afridi, and other unnamed parties.[18][19][20]\\nOn 10 March, the British government froze all of Roman Abramovich\\'s assets due to his close personal ties with Vladimir Putin, leaving Chelsea unable to sell tickets or merchandise, buy or sell players, and negotiate contracts.[21][22] The UK government issued Chelsea a licence that allowed the club to continue footballing activities, ensured that employees continued to be paid, and allowed season-ticket holders to continue to attend games.[23]\\nThe end of the season saw the title race, Champions League, Europa League, Conference League qualifications, and the relegation battle all decided on the final day for the first time in Premier League history.[24]\\nHeading into the final day of the season, Manchester City led by a solitary point, meaning City needed to match or better Liverpool\\'s result to clinch back-to-back titles. Liverpool needed to win and hope that Manchester City dropped points to Aston Villa, managed by former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard.[25]\\nLiverpool went behind to Wolves in the 3rd minute, but quickly equalised. Aston Villa took a shock 2–0 lead after 63 minutes thanks to goals from Matty Cash and Philippe Coutinho. Manchester City then scored three goals (from substitute Ilkay Gundogan and Rodri) in under six minutes to take the lead in the match. Two late goals from Liverpool meant they won their game 3–1, but the final results confirmed City as champions for the fourth time in five seasons.[26]\\nNorwich City, who were promoted from the Championship last season, suffered relegation with four games to spare following a 10th loss in 12 matches, against Aston Villa. Norwich also recorded the worst goal difference since Derby County in 2007–08.[27] The next weekend Watford, who were also promoted, were the second to go down after defeat to Crystal Palace.[28]\\nThe final relegation spot was contested by Everton, Burnley and Leeds United, all of whom spent time in the bottom three in the final months of the season. Everton endured a run of just three wins between October and April, but victories against Manchester United, Chelsea and Leicester City meant that victory over Crystal Palace in their final home game of the season would secure safety. Although they went 2–0 down at half time, Dominic Calvert-Lewin\\'s goal in the 85th minute to put Everton 3–2 ahead had fans invading the pitch.[29] Fans stormed the pitch again at full time, after avoiding what would have been the club\\'s first relegation since 1951 and prolonging their top-flight status for a 69th year running.[30]\\nBurnley and Leeds went into the final day level on 35 points, with Burnley having the edge over Leeds due to a superior goal difference. Burnley fell behind 2–0 to Newcastle, while a Raphinha penalty put Leeds ahead in the 54th minute. A 78th minute equaliser from Brentford and a Maxwel Cornet goal gave Burnley hope of survival, but an added time winner from Jack Harrison confirmed safety for Leeds and relegated Burnley after six consecutive seasons in the Premier League.[31]\\nWith Chelsea securing a top-four finish for a fourth straight season, only Tottenham and Arsenal were in the hunt for the final Champions League spot. Arsenal were in 4th with three games remaining, but Arsenal\\'s defeats against Tottenham in the North London derby and Newcastle in their final away game saw Tottenham leapfrog them with one game remaining.[32] Spurs just needed a point against already relegated Norwich on the final day to secure Champions League qualification for the first time in three years, and won 5–0 with two goals from Son Heung-min, who secured a joint Golden Boot with Mohamed Salah. Arsenal failed to qualify for the Champions League for a fifth season, despite beating Everton 5–1.[33]\\nManchester United, despite the return of Cristiano Ronaldo, announced the departure of Ole Gunnar Solskjær on 21 November.[34][35] Results did not improve under Ralf Rangnick as they were already out of the Champions League after posting a goal difference of zero and finishing with their worst points tally in the Premier League era.[36] However, despite losing 1–0 at Selhurst Park on the last day of the season, 58 points was enough for a Europa League spot following West Ham’s 3–1 defeat at Brighton, stopping them from qualifying for back-to-back Europa League spots; they instead had to settle for a spot in the Europa Conference League.[37]\\nBrentford manager Thomas Frank had a promising first season in the Premier League. Thanks to January signing Christian Eriksen, the team won seven out of their last 11 games of the season, which included a 4–1 victory against Chelsea. The Dane guided the Bees to a 13th place finish, 11 points above the relegation zone and not spending a single week in the relegation zone.[38]\\nBrighton had their best season in the top-flight with Graham Potter\\'s side finishing ninth with a total of 51 points, despite their poor home record.[39] Their 4–0 win against Manchester United was another new high for them, as it was also their biggest top-flight win.[40]\\nTwenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams are Norwich City, Watford (who both return to the top flight after a year\\'s absence) and Brentford (who return to the top flight after a seventy-four year absence). This was also Brentford\\'s first season in the Premier League.[41] They replaced Fulham, West Bromwich Albion (both teams relegated after just one year in the top flight) and Sheffield United (relegated after a two-year top flight spell).[42]\\n4 Player scored 4 goals(H) – Home team(A) – Away team\\n',\n",

       " \"Details revealed for Kena’s free Anniversary Update, out September 27\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEmber Lab celebrates one year since releasing their debut game with a trove of free new content.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt’s been one year since our launch. To celebrate, we’re thrilled to share our biggest update yet – the Anniversary Update! As a thank you for your amazing support we’ve expanded the Kena experience with many new features, including: New Game+, Charmstones, Spirit Guide Trials, Kena Outfits, accessibility features, and more.The Anniversary Update will be a free update available to all PS4 and PS5 players, new and old, on September 27.During development, we aimed to take fans’ comments into consideration while also adding more unique features and gameplay to expand the experience. New Game+ has been a big one! Once players have completed the game, they will have the opportunity to convert their save file into a New Game+ game. From there, they will restart Kena’s journey with all of their previously unlocked Abilities, Upgrades, Outfits, Rot, etc. as they face redesigned and more challenging combat encounters. Combat encounters adjustments even include new enemy types unique to NG+. Many bosses even have some additional phases.Charmstones are another big addition coming in our September 27 update. Individually equipable – these unique collectibles each provide different adjustments to Kena’s stats and abilities. Some Charmstones contain a benefit and a drawback, encouraging players to strategize about how they want to take on certain enemies and challenges. Rare Cursed Charmstones are aimed at players who want a serious challenge by attacking the game with reduced abilities. Players will find most Charmstones hidden around Kena’s world, with a few connected to another big addition: Spirit Guide Trials.In a whole new game mode accessed from the Mask Shrine, the Spirit Guide Trials will challenge players’ skills. By building a variety of replayable challenges, we wanted to encourage all players to test out different combinations of their upgrades and deepen their combat experience. The Spirit Guide Trials fall into three different categories: Obstacle Courses, Wave Defenses, and Boss Reflects.\\xa0Each Trial can be played as many times as players want and include various objectives to complete within that particular Trial. In the Obstacle Courses for example, players focus on Kena’s primary abilities: the Bow, Bomb, and Dash as they navigate through courses designed to test their accuracy, timing, and platforming.\\xa0Wave Defenses pit players against multiple rounds of increasingly difficult enemies. They must think strategically while pacing themselves through multiple waves of unique scenarios with limited chances to heal. We’ve prepared some pretty exciting and hair-raising enemy combinations here, so be prepared.Finally, Boss Reflects allow players to revisit their favorite boss fights and perfect their tactics. While we love the excitement of all of our smaller combat encounters, we’re particularly fond of a good bossfight. We wanted to make sure players had the opportunity to retry these exciting events to their hearts’ content within one playthrough, experiment with new approaches, and become true masters.What about the rewards? By completing Trials, players have the opportunity to unlock Outfits for Kena, each one inspired by one of the characters she meets along her journey. Succeeding at bonus objectives within each trial can unlock color variations of each outfit, as well as some unique Charmstones.\\xa0There’s even an exclusive outfit for Deluxe Edition owners.We hope players enjoy replaying or continuing their playthrough of Kena: Bridge of Spirits with these constant reminders of the special characters Kena helps along her journey as a Spirit Guide. (Plus, we also just think they look pretty cool). Even as we’ve been testing them, every time we play with a different outfit, we’re reminded of helping Beni and Saiya find their brother for the first time, or learning how to channel the bow from Rusu.We can’t wait to share all of these additions with the Anniversary Update on September 27.\\nDid you like this?\\n\\nLike this\\n\\n \\n\\nShare this storyJoin the ConversationBut don't be a jerk!\\n\\tPlease be kind, considerate, and constructive.

       " \"How Ghost Pattern built the story-driven world of Wayward Strand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGhost Pattern reveals never-before-seen development details for the immersive theater-inspired game, out September 15.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHey, I’m Goldie, the art director for Wayward Strand, coming to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on September 15 (that’s so soon!!)For the first time in the six years since Ghost Pattern was formed, me and the team are sharing a deep dive into the making of our real-time, simultaneously told story, Wayward Strand, starring Casey, a 14-year-old aspiring journalist, as she follows her curiosity wherever it takes her.Early artwork of how the ship might be loaded up with supplies, by me! Goldie BartlettFrom the start, the game was heavily inspired by immersive theater, slice-of-life comics, and graphic novels. Something I love about this format is that there’s a lot of space and area to tuck moments in amongst the larger plot points and knots of storylines.Our team created Wayward Strand’s characters based on personal experiences and stories from people in our lives, particularly older people. We wanted our characters to be active within the story, as opposed to waiting around for the player to come by before they do anything. Georgia Symons, one of Wayward Strand’s writers, remembers that “the goal was to give each character the potential to ‘move the story forward’, through whatever actions they take.”In early demos we were excited by how simultaneous storylines give the player the opportunity to happen upon scenes or storylines in mid-flow. It helps the player both understand and feel that there is a world of activity going on outside of their character.Ghost Pattern’s earliest mock-up of the Day 1 schedule in 2016/2017. Each row, a different character and each column a time of day.Wayward Strand’s other writer, Jason Bakker, feels like telling many storylines at the same time means we can really round out our characters. “It allows each character to have quiet moments, time to themselves. Each character can be the centre of attention for a bit, then the player can follow them as they return to their rooms, and be with them as they process what just happened.”Screenshot of the current build, at the front of the ship overlooking the coast.We’ve challenged ourselves to make every character as interesting as possible over the course of three in-game days, and that’s a part of making Wayward Strand I’ve absolutely loved. Often I’d have a conversation with someone — my mum or an aunty or a friend — they’d tell me some story about someone they once knew and I’d think, “that is SUCH an Esther thing to do” or ‘that’s exactly how Joe (one of the nurses) must be feeling about Dr. Bouchard’. Over the past six years, little nuances that relate to people we know have been added to the characters piece by piece.An early rendering of Casey visiting Ida using 3D modeling.We’ve gone through many generations of the visuals for our living world. Our first plans were to explore fully-3D spaces in an over-the-shoulder format, within a single-story hospital; when you went into a scene, the camera would cut around as each character spoke. In that demo, we weren’t seeing the larger backdrop of the busyness of the hospital, or even the beautiful sea/skies outside, and decided to go in a fundamentally different direction.A scrapped layout of the ship, where the rooms were laid out widthwise.Maize Wallin, our audio director, says the change to a side-on view is one of the key experiential differences. “This side-on doll’s house view makes it much clearer to the player that there’s constantly things happening around them.” We built our next demo in a side-on style, where the camera looked “down the barrel” of the ship, and rooms were laid out widthwise. Only after working with Su-Yiin Lai, an architectural consultant, did we discover that lengthwise was the best way to achieve the comic-book style we were hoping for – this was the final rebuild, and what you’ll see in game.An early design of the lengthwise hospital airship.How the ship looks today!One thing we’ve been confident in since the very early days is that the game should be fully voiced; as well as wanting the game to benefit from actors’ performances, like theater, we needed the player to be able to hear all the conversations going on around you as you play. We did two rounds of ‘practice’ voice-over recording sessions in 2016 and 2018, which taught us that the voice-over production for the full-game would be a massive undertaking.And it was – over the course of six weeks we spent 30 days with our actors, across four studios around the world. Maize, the technical audio director for the VO sessions, says we’ve recorded over 18,000 lines of dialogue; the equivalent of about eighteen feature-length movies. It took cohesive narrative direction, programming, technical audio, and audio engineering and voiceover audio specialists to make it all possible.Casey is heard making many hellos!As we’ve gotten close to release, we’ve been watching people play the game and realised although many things have changed along the journey, our core goals never wavered. When you play Wayward Strand, you’re spending time in a living world surrounded by interesting, complex characters and their evolving stories, inspired by personal experience and real history.We’re so excited for you to experience it yourself on September 15, on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4!\\nDid you like this?\\n\\nLike this\\n\\n \\n\\nShare this storyJoin the ConversationBut don't be a jerk!\\n\\tPlease be kind, considerate, and constructive.

       " \"Meet Your Maker revealed, a brutal new take on building and raiding\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Explore the gameplay, world, and lore of Behaviour Interactive’s next major release, coming in 2023.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHot on the heels of its world premiere reveal, we’re here to take you even deeper into the brutal world of Meet Your Maker.\\xa0Let’s start with a quick recap of the game itself, coming to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 in 2023.\\xa0Meet Your Maker is a new first-person building-and-raiding game set in a dark post-apocalyptic future. Gameplay revolves around the creation and infiltration of stand-alone levels called Outposts, as players seek to protect or steal the world’s most precious remaining resource from each other.\\xa0Building is focused on strategic, block-based design, where players will draw from a highly customizable toolbox of traps and guards to mastermind deadly maze-like Outposts. Raiders, on the other hand, will suit up for methodical, lightning-fast combat as they enter and attempt to overcome other players’ creations.\\xa0The experience is one truly driven by user-generated content, and every single Outpost in the game is designed by players, for players.\\xa0While the unique gameplay of Meet Your Maker takes center stage at first glance, similar to Behaviour’s long-running multiplayer horror hit Dead by Daylight, there’s also a rich mythology waiting to be discovered.\\xa0Communicate with the Chimera via a unique psychic bond.“Humanity has been facing extinction ever since a genetic disease swept the globe hundreds of years ago,” explains Joe Dermo, Meet Your Maker’s lead narrative designer. “Desperate nations waged war over resources, riots broke out, and societies collapsed. However, humanity didn’t roll over and die.“There was an era where several gifted world leaders proposed Sanctuaries—highly advanced research labs across the world that could work independently and cooperatively on world-saving initiatives. One such initiative was the Chimera Project, which would create hybrid-humans by distilling uncorrupted genetic material through those who have shown resistance to the disease.\\xa0“After hundreds of years, the project continues towards its goal, though the evolution of the Chimera has gone down an unexpected path…”.A harvester loads genetic material into the shipping station for transport back to the Sanctuary.Players will assume the role of the Custodian, a clone tasked with seeking out the remaining uncorrupted genetic material and either defending or stealing it. You are the last hope for completing the Chimera Project – but gathering this coveted resource won’t be easy.“Uncorrupted genetic material is exceedingly rare due to this disease that’s swept the world, yet it’s the one thing needed to complete the Chimera Project and hopefully bring about a cure, “continues Joe. “As it dwindles in supply, Sanctuaries led by Chimera have begun to fight over it.”The fight in question takes place within Outposts built by players to extract genetic material. The heart of each Outpost is its extractor cube, filling canisters with the precious resource.\\xa0Builders will need to tap into their most devious impulses, creating a gauntlet of traps and monstrous guards designed to lure, outwit, and tear trespassing players limb from limb. Raiders will need sharp reflexes, anticipation, and perseverance to not only fight their way to the extractor cube and steal its canister, but also escape with it in hand.\\xa0“The scarcity of genetic material really drives the two sides of the game in Meet Your Maker,” shares Ash Pannell, the game’s Creative Director. “Making the building blocks of life the driving narrative concept helps to raise the stakes. It allows us to create gameplay themes that are morally grey, asking the question, ‘What is humanity? The physical stuff we’re made out of – or something more?’”Speak with any of the Sanctuary’s five Advisors, your only allies in an unforgiving world.Between building and raiding sessions, players will return to the Sanctuary, their hub and base of operations. In addition to the Chimera, the Sanctuary also houses five Advisors; clones who run the facility.\\xa0Progression is achieved by supplying both them and the Chimera with genetic material which unlocks new traps, guards, suits, weapons, perks, and even lore for those eager to peel back the layers of this dying world.\\xa0“Speaking to your Advisors is a great way to learn about the world’s lore,” explains Joe. “Occasionally, they’ll mention something that touches on the greater history and hints at upcoming stories for them. And for those looking to deep dive into the mythology of Meet Your Maker, our ever-growing Codex has a history of every item and character in the game.”Through new content and an ever-expanding toolbox, this is a game that will only get bigger over time, and fans can rest assured its mythology will continue to expand alongside it.\\xa0“Though a lot is still in the planning phase, we’ll be looking at ways that players can actively seek out lore and uncover new – and sometimes shocking – information about the world and characters they interact with.”Meet Your Maker releases in 2023 on PS4 and PS5.\\nDid you like this?\\n\\nLike this\\n\\n \\n\\nShare this storyJoin the ConversationBut don't be a jerk!\\n\\tPlease be kind, considerate, and constructive.

       " \"Playground and Duos mode revealed for Rumbleverse launch, out August 11\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPartner up with a fellow Rumbler in Duos and grapple at your own pace in the Playground mode.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHey PlayStation Nation! The launch of Rumbleverse — the free-to-play, 40-person brawler — is nearly here! On August 11 the Battle Barge will officially open its slipway to all Rumblers as a free download on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. Get ready; this is the start of your exciting career as a Rumbler!\\xa0\\xa0You’re invited to Grapital City, where everyone lives for the fight and dreams of becoming a champion. Create your unique fighter and prepare to be shot out of a cannon, where you and 39 other contestants are launched into the streets of Grapital City to rumble. Dash through streets and scale buildings in search of upgrades, found on every corner and rooftop in the city. Then pick a fight, flex your moves, knock out your opponents, and be the last Rumbler standing.So, what’s new for launch?We really enjoyed watching you all strive to be a Solo Mode champion during our playtest sessions. The fun really begins on August 11th, when Duos Mode goes live. Fight side by side with a friend, share loot, protect each other, and win together!\\xa0Duos Mode takes all the moment-to-moment gameplay you know and love from our Solo Brawler Royale experience and twists it into something brand new.\\xa0 Every situation takes on a new set of strategic questions for you and your partner to answer. Want to risk landing on a hotspot like the Trophy Heights Water Tower to get all that loot?\\xa0 If one of you gets thrown off, the other will be left without backup, raising the stakes. Want to move and loot together? If you stay too close, you’ll be collecting and sharing one player’s worth of items.\\xa0 If you separate too much, you may be vulnerable to sneak attacks from aggressive Duos that leave you outnumbered.In Duos Mode, you start with only eight slots for your stats, and a bit less Max Health than you do when you play alone. Additionally, you won’t have access to the Superstar Comeback system. If your teammate gets eliminated, you will get additional Max Health and Stat Slots awarded to you to help keep you in the fight.\\xa0 Don’t worry though, as running out of Health in Duos mode won’t KO you right away.If your teammate runs out of health, they’ll be Downed and in need of Help. To Help your teammate, simply stand near them and press the Interact button (Circle) to cheer them back to their feet. You’ll have 30 seconds to do so, but if your teammate is Downed again, you’ll get progressively less time to help them. Sounds simple?\\xa0 It is… until enemy teams are hovering over your friend trying to stop you.\\xa0 Try using the Vicious Blast (hold Triangle) or activating your Superstar Mode to push opponents away from your friend, and then help them up as quickly as you can. As a bonus, if you attempt to help a teammate while Superstar Mode is activated, you’ll help them up twice as fast.Communication and teamwork are the key to victory. Share items. Go for complimentary builds. Help each other when enemies are attacking. You can knock your teammates down, but you won’t hurt them (unless water is involved). If you want a real thrill, try tossing an enemy into the air and letting your teammate connect a follow-up attack.\\xa0 Create the team combos of your dreams and get your fans really amped up.Want to explore the city at your own pace and perfect your moves? Looking for a few lessons on how to play before you launch head-first out of a giant cannon?\\xa0 Check out our free roam experience, Playground Mode. The city will be fully open to explore. Seek out training modules in different neighborhoods to learn gameplay lessons. Spar with the high-tech robots to help you unlock your inner champion. Explore on your own or with a friend. Enjoy Grapital City at your own speed.\\xa0You can join a Playground server alone or with a friend.\\xa0 If you bring a friend, you won’t be paired as a team.\\xa0 This will allow you to fight each other or create your own fun in a multitude of ways.\\xa0 If you are eliminated while you are in Playground, you can press the Option button to respawn nearby.Press Option to open the map screen and see the locations and topic names for all the lessons scattered around the city, as well as the locations of the Equip Up zones. You can also toggle Combat Mode on or off using the map screen.\\xa0 If you toggle Combat Mode off, you can still interact with our robot training dummies, but other players will not be able to bother you.\\xa0 When you arrive at a lesson location, you can use the training monitors to pop-up lessons. There are 8 topic locations with a huge variety of lessons to read.\\xa0 Learn at your own pace; there is no need to read everything in one visit.Seek out an Equip Up zone if you want to mess around with any of the items that the Rumble has to offer. Here, you can find every special move in the game, as well as every weapon and every consumable.\\xa0 And all of them will respawn! Try out everything to your heart’s content. Or just bring a friend and do foot races across the wide open city. Play it your way!\\xa0You’ll have one week to warm up, stretch out, and practice your favorite super moves for the main event. Season One kicks off on August 18! The Season One Battle Pass is packed with 100 rewards you’ll unlock by earning Fame and progressing your Rumbler’s career. Rewards include accessories and accessory sets to customize your look, Title Cards, emotes, and more. Be sure to customize your Title Card on the Career page. Opponents you eliminate will get a glimpse of all the training you’ve put in.You’ll be able to purchase the Battle Pass from the shop for 1,000 Brawla Bills, Rumbleverse’s in-game currency. To sweeten the deal, completing the Battle Pass will earn you 1,500 Brawla Bills. It looks like someone skipped math class for leg day, folks.\\xa0We’re not just launching a game — we’re beginning a journey. Stay tuned for a steady stream of updates, special events, and new ways to rumble.\\xa0 The wait is almost over. The Rumble calls you.

       " \"PlayStation Plus Game Catalog lineup for August: Yakuza 0, Trials of Mana, Dead by Daylight, Bugsnax\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAlso added this month: Yakuza Kiwami, Yakuza Kiwami 2, Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands and more.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tToday we’re happy to reveal August’s Game Catalog lineup for PlayStation Plus, which will be available to play for Extra and Premium members on August 16. It’s headlined by three Yakuza games (which will soon be followed by other entries in the series later this year). But rubbing shoulders with the crime series will be multiplayer horror Dead by Daylight, open world shooter Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands and whimsical adventure Bugsnax.\\xa0Let’s take a closer look at the lineup.The glitz, glamour, and unbridled decadence of the 80s are back in Yakuza 0. Fight like hell through Tokyo and Osaka with protagonist Kazuma Kiryu and series regular Goro Majima. Play as the former to discover how he finds himself in a world of trouble when a simple debt collection goes wrong. Then, step into the silver-toed shoes of Goro Majima and explore his “normal” life as the proprietor of a cabaret club.\\xa0The first Yakuza title debuted in 2005 on PS2. This PS4 remake rebuilds that experience from scratch. Follow the early days of Kazuma Kiryu as he returns to the streets of Japan after serving a decade-long prison sentence for a crime he didn’t commit to save his best friend.\\xa0Yakuza’s sequel receives the remake treatment, not only updating the original but expanding it with a playable adventure starring Goro Majima set before the events of the main game. A year after the events of the first Yakuza, an assassination pulls Kazuma Kiryu out of a peaceful life to broker peace between rival clans and face off against Ryuji Goda, known as the Dragon of Kansai.\\xa0Dead by Daylight is a 1v4 multiplayer game that draws from all corners of the horror world from a powerful slasher to a terrifying paranormal entity. Choose between playing an unstoppable Killer and one of 4 Survivors trying to evade a gruesome death. Each character has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your personal strategy. Work together to escape, or stalk and sacrifice every Survivor.Create a team with up to 3 friends and enjoy the ultimate military shooter experience set in a massive, dangerous, and responsive open world. Create and fully customize your Ghost, weapons, and gear.

       " \"How Guerrilla created Vegas in Horizon Forbidden West\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tA deep dive into the creation of far-future Las Vegas with Guerrilla’s designers.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHorizon Forbidden West sees Aloy traverse dangerous and harsh environments in search of Gaia’s sub-functions, with hopes of restoring the planet’s terraforming system, rebalancing the biosphere and saving life on Earth. Though our story is set 1,000 years into the future, players will uncover and recognize many iconic locations from our real world today.DISCLAIMER: Please note that this behind-the-scenes feature contains major spoilers for the storyline and many gameplay elements of Horizon Forbidden West. To get the most out of this in-depth article, we would strongly recommend completing the quest The Sea of Sands prior to reading.During the quest The Sea of Sands, Aloy ventures into the arid Stillsands Desert in her search for Poseidon, one of Gaia’s sub-functions. At first, the desert appears desolate, however, hidden under the sands are the flooded ruins known as Dunehollow, formerly Las Vegas.It is up to Aloy to piece together data fragments left behind a millennium earlier by a businessman called Stanley Chen and reactivate the city’s long-forgotten water systems in order to gain access to Poseidon.Guerrilla Quest Designer Samantha Schoonen led the development of this quest, The Sea of Sands, from start to finish. To bring this vision to life, she did a lot of research on Vegas’ iconic Strip.\\xa0“We looked into casinos and ideated on crazy ideas for far-future Vegas buildings,” says Schoonen. “I drew a lot of inspiration from our concept art as well, and we thought of things like a broken-down roller coaster area, remnants of a pirate ship, and a rooftop swimming pool – we worked a lot with our art departments to figure out what would work, though of course not everything made it into the final game.”Designing this epic questline was a long process full of iteration and collaboration, says Samantha. “For main quests, we always start out with a story summary provided by our Narrative team,” she says. “Based on that summary, we write a design document containing all information, like story beats, quest objectives, a world map of the area to provide an overview of the quest flow and locations, and a detailed description of these areas.“We then make an outline of the space. I use in-game reference images to get an idea of the level design and space itself, the outlines. But it’s hard to get a scale of the place while only working in 2D, so as soon as possible, I create a 3D layout in our Decima Engine. We then continue to iterate on flow and level design until everyone is satisfied.”“Building a quest that uses water was always going to be a challenge,” says Schoonen. “I remember how difficult it was to build the Waterlogged quest for Horizon Zero Dawn: Frozen Wilds, and of course, Las Vegas would be a lot bigger! We worked closely with various teams like tech, visual effects, and lighting to ensure we had the systems in place for underwater quests to function. We wanted to control where the water would be, as well as the air pockets, and visibility had to be adjustable.“We worked closely together with core design as well, who were in charge of the swimming mechanics. This would be the first quest where the player was able to dive to depths that were unreachable before.”Core Systems Designer Lennart Hoting worked on quite a few traversal aspects, including swimming and diving, which are new in Horizon Forbidden West. “We were looking for new heights and depths to explore and new types of natural beauty to showcase,” says Hoting. “As the underwater world is inherently fascinating and mysterious, it felt like a natural extension to traverse long-lost unknown places, such as Las Vegas. We consciously turned away from any oppressive tone of underwater gameplay and focused on fast and agile traversal, with enemy encounters revolving around stealth to add tension.“Early in development, we investigated which aspects of water could make for interesting gameplay challenges while also increasing immersion. Water currents soon came to mind. Aloy will sometimes encounter strong water currents that push her away from where she wants to go. You can attempt to sprint through them, but the best way to get through is to make use of underwater boost bars. Aloy can grab onto these and push off of them to gain a short burst of speed which can launch her straight through.”As Aloy acquires the Diving Mask, giving her unlimited air underwater, she plunges into the ruins of Vegas. “Our initial routes for traversal were way too long, so we decided to have a single elevator shaft to go up or down,” says Schoonen. “This shaft could not be too large due to the above-ground visuals, nor too small for the player to move around in or the elevator to be able to function once the quest was completed.“Once Aloy swims down the elevator shaft, she gets into a Casino space and eventually into the lobby. I really wanted the player to immediately be caught off guard by the Tideripper before becoming aware of the size of the space as a grand opening.”There are some rather dangerous machines in the waters of the Forbidden West, including Burrowers, Snapmaws, and the huge Tiderippers. “Aloy has no way of attacking while swimming, so she has to be smart and stealthy to circumvent enemies,” Hoting adds. “The best way to stay out of sight is to use smoke bombs or hide in kelp. These plants grow dense enough that they stop unaware machines from spotting you while giving you the opportunity to peek out while hiding inside. This creates a moment of extremely tactical cat-and-mouse gameplay.”Samantha continues on this subterranean location. “The underground dome is a dangerous place teeming with machines, so we added a few structures for the player to hide in as they move between hiding spots,” she says. “The machines are on patrol paths, which change whenever a node is activated. We then place the machines alongside the player’s route to their next location to create an ever-present threat.“A lot of the areas went through various iterations, as the building entrances, nodes, and sewers needed to be out of sight but not impossible to locate. Real-world Las Vegas sources its water from the Nevada Hoover Dam, so we wanted to convey something similar with the holographic map the player encounters early in the quest.“We were so inspired by Vegas and wanted to make the quest worthwhile. By putting in multiple elements, like tracking, combat, stealth, and small traversal puzzles, the player is given lots of variety in gameplay to make it feel fresh. It was definitely tricky to add enough elements without relying on combat and puzzles, which mostly rely on physics. That’s why we also added some air pocket spaces where the player could traverse and interact with the environment.”After Aloy successfully makes her way through the Snapmaw-infested waters and activates Stanley Chen’s ancient water management system, the water drains from the city. Suddenly, the scale of the dome, and the buildings within, becomes clear. Aloy must navigate them more traditionally by climbing, gliding, and running, with the dome becoming a large arena for an awesome battle.Remember that Tideripper mentioned earlier? With most of the water now drained from Dunehollow, Aloy will still need to deal with this challenging machine before finally getting to Poseidon.Samantha Schoonen explains how the arena for this battle was created. “We worked together with the combat team as this space required several elements to work,” she says. “the Tideripper needed a body of water to emerge from, so we built something of a beach where it could refill its Purgewater Sacs. The arena also needed to be quite deep so the player wouldn’t accidentally leave the area. Lastly, it needed a flat space for the Tideripper to move and, of course, grapple points to give Aloy a quick getaway – though some of those had to be destructible for an added challenge!”After defeating the Tideripper and obtaining Poseidon, Las Vegas truly comes back to life. Mesmerizing holograms illuminate the sky with ghostly outlines of buildings that collapsed long ago; memories of a forgotten city.\\xa0“Having Vegas visually flourish was always part of the narrative vision for this quest,” Schoonen says with a smile. “Poseidon took over the Vegas water and power supply which was connected to the holograms. After Aloy fights the AI, the system fully reboots and the original holograms take their place lighting up the night sky. The quest’s ending was a huge collaboration; teams like concept art, cinematics, environment art, visual effects, and lighting all worked together on that beautiful moment. I only placed them in the right locations and made sure they showed up at the right time.“We all put a lot of love into building this area. I’m astonished by how well this quest has been received, and I’m happy to hear the community has had a great time playing through this underwater world!”As far as her own favorite moment, Samantha Schoonen finds this hard to choose. “For a designer, a game is never finished,” she says. “I’d have to look back ten years from now to have a clear opinion because I played through it so often during development. I think it’s more the entire journey of building this quest; that’s my favorite part.”And as for Lennart, he says, “I really liked seeing that many players enjoyed the underwater sections of the game and that some even said these were their favorite parts. The response to the Sea of Sands quest, and the love for unique characters like Morlund you meet along the way, was especially great; it is one of my favorite quests. While some players remained anxious about diving, the Diving Mask seemed to really turn these sections into something players enjoy. Reading that people were able to overcome their fears and enjoy the diving experience is amazing.”There’s much more to discover in and around Vegas following the Sea of Sands quest, now featuring a settlement called Hidden Ember; we’d definitely encourage you to return for a special quest with Morlund, speak to Porguf in Camp Nowhere, or deliver Ornaments to Stemmur, and wonder about the holidays of the Old Ones as they light up the Vegas skies.If you’re interested in more of the story behind the Vegas ruins, you can watch back our recent livestream with Samantha here (we’re live every Thursday at 4PM CEST, www.twitch.tv/guerrilla).\\nDid you like this?\\n\\nLike this\\n\\n \\n\\nShare this storyJoin the ConversationBut don't be a jerk!\\n\\tPlease be kind, considerate, and constructive.

       " \"Get the lowdown on Fallout 76’s Expeditions before entering The Pitt\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Be prepared to step outside Appalachia’s borders this September with a primer on Expeditions.\\xa0\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFallout 76 players are about to venture into new territory. This September, the Expeditions update whisks players to a perilous location outside the wild reaches of Appalachia: The Pitt!Built on what’s left of Pre-War Pittsburgh, The Pitt is a rough place. The local Union faction is beset on all sides as bloodthirsty Raiders and once-human Trog beasts close in, so grab your friends, pack your best gear and steel yourself…it’s time to go on an Expedition.“Expedition missions are randomized and repeatable story-based missions on the scale of our most epic end-of-line quests, such as the Vault 79 raid at the end of Wastelanders,” explains Steve Massey, Lead Designer on Fallout 76’s Expeditions. “We developed a new Quest Module system which allows us to easily randomize and retheme quest objectives in order to make each mission playthrough feel truly unique and blend seamlessly into the overarching mission story.”Players can tackle missions either solo or in a group with up to four people – either with friends or by using the new Expedition Public Teams feature included in the update. Players can earn a unique item plan once per week upon completing an Expedition, as well as collect Stamps in order to claim specific items from the reward pool. Players can also earn repeatable rewards including legendary items, Scrip, Treasury Notes and even an all-new method for gaining Legendary Modules.Of course, there’s more to Expeditions than precious loot. Expeditions lets Fallout fans visit The Pitt for the first time since 2009’s add-on DLC for Fallout 3. With Fallout 76 set prior to the events of Fallout 3, Expeditions offer both exciting replayable missions, but also give players a chance to truly explore Pittsburgh in a fascinating era of Fallout lore, seeing the city in a new light…and previewing its coming darkness.“The team felt passionate about allowing players to explore other parts of the Fallout universe outside of Appalachia in this unique time period, only a few decades after the Great War,” Massey continues. “The Pitt was an obvious choice for the first city to visit, because in Fallout 3 it was such a bleak and unforgiving landscape that you ask yourself, ‘How did things get to be so bad?’.” In the future, the format of Expeditions also gives us the opportunity to take players to brand-new locales in the Fallout universe that no existing game has touched upon before.”While any player can sign up for an Expedition solo or as a group, be warned: It can get dangerous out there. It’s suggested that you first reach Level 50 or higher for the best experience stepping into The Pitt, with greater challenges awaiting solo Expeditionaries than those bringing along a few friends.“Much like other high-level story-based quests in the game, Expedition missions have combat tuned to be satisfying – but not overly punishing,” Massey says. “Players should come well-equipped, but all enemies drop relevant ammo and Stimpaks to help keep them going in the field.” Want to play with someone at a different level? Nothing to worry: Like other content in the game, enemies during Expeditions scale based on player level. “A low-level player can accompany a high-level friend on a mission and both will experience an appropriate level of difficulty,” assures Massey.Speaking of newer players, the Expedition update also includes other enhancements to the game such as adjusted starting gear and other additions benefiting fresh-faced Vault Dwellers just stepping out into Appalachia.“The Whitespring Resort has been completely revamped into a player hub called Whitespring Refuge,” says Massey. “Players will participate in Refuge Daily Quests, experience a brand-new random encounter system and repair/purchase/craft almost anything in the game that they want in the lower Whitespring Mall area. Additionally, the update comes with a ton of frequently requested quality-of-life changes, including the ability to fast-travel directly into the interiors of frequently visited locations like The Whitespring and The Rusty Pick without spending any Caps.”That’s the scoop on Expeditions – now it’s time to train up. Jump into Fallout 76 and explore, build and commune with players in your very own slice of post-nuclear West Virginia today! The Expedition update arrives free for Fallout 76 players this September, playable on both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 systems. Until then, we’ll see you inside (and soon, outside) Appalachia!\\nDid you like this?\\n\\nLike this\\n\\n \\n\\nShare this storyJoin the ConversationBut don't be a jerk!\\n\\tPlease be kind, considerate, and constructive.

       " \"Cursed to Golf is out today on PS5 and PS4\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t The devil is in the details as Liam Edwards takes us through some of the deeper challenges awaiting us in Golf Purgatory.\\xa0\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe time has finally come, Cursed to Golf is out TODAY on PS5 and PS4. It’s been 2 years of hard work and passion to get here. The team and I are immensely proud of our game, and we hope you all take our virtual trip to the afterlife to live out your days in Golf Purgatory. Last time I was here I spoke about the general rules of supernatural golf, the incredible power of the Ace Cards and some of the shenanigans you can get down to in between holes. Today, let’s get down and dirty with some of the more perilous elements of Cursed to Golf. After all, if you want to make it out of Golf Purgatory, it pays to take some risks.At the end of each biome lies its ultimate challenge – the Legendary Caddie that oversees that part of the course. In Purgatory you’ll find The Scotsman, in the Desert you’ll face The Explorer, and the Caves are home to The Forgotten. These golf battles mix up the gameplay slightly and offer up a few differences to the traditional purgatorial golf gameplay you’ll encounter on the rest of the course. Not only do you have to keep tabs on your shot counter, but you also need to beat the boss by sinking your ball before them. However, in addition to Shot Idols that replenish your shot count, these battles include Stun Idols. Smashing through one of these will knock the boss down, making them miss a turn.These golfers don’t play around, hitting incredible shots that defy the laws of physics! If you want to take down a Legendary Caddie, you’ll need to master your Ace Cards, make use of the best shortcuts, and ensure to smash through a load of totems on your way to the flagpole. Luckily, the boss hole will always stay the same, so you can learn it as you play and experiment to find the best strategy to complete it.The Scotsman’s hole is designed for his characteristic long drives. It’s also peppered with both hazards and shortcuts both up high and down low, so don’t forget to use your Birdie Eye to get a true lay of the land and plan which road you want to take. Beating The Scotsman will unlock the “Comeback” boon, giving you the chance to place a checkpoint flag once per run. Upon your (almost certain) death, instead of being booted back to the beginning of the course, you’ll be transported back to your flag. Not only that, but you’ll have all the Ace Cards and cash you had when you placed it originally, ready for another swing at the course!The Explorer’s hole is a sand dune filled nightmare, expect to be perfecting your wedge game over there, because you’ll be landing in the bunker constantly. On top of that, The Explorer has a special ability – she can alter the hole right in the middle of it being played. You may land on a suspiciously flat and safe area, only to find a towering dune erupt out of the ground before you, sheesh! Beating The Explorer will net you the “Gimmie” boon, giving you 5 extra shots in a pinch when your shot count reaches 0. This powerful boon refreshes every hole, so don’t feel precious about it.The Forgotten’s Hole is a deep, cavernous maze full of diverging paths, deviously placed hazards, and tricksy false flagpoles that house golf ball eating dinosaurs. You’ll not only be contending with The Forgotten, but also her two pet birds Eagle and Albatross. These feathery blighters will stop at nothing to ensure The Forgotten beats you. If you land in one of their zones, they’ll whisk your ball away into a hazard, losing you shots and putting you in tough spots for your next swing.They’ll also grab The Forgotten’s ball and fly her past tough obstacles, dropping her in opportunistic positions for her next shot. There’s no way of sugarcoating it, this is one tough battle, but should you prevail, you will unlock the “Recovery” boon. With Recovery, upon death you’ll be able to keep your Ace Card deck and use it on your next run, giving you one big leg up straight from the beginning of Hole 1. Because we’re not complete masochists, once a boss is defeated, you don’t need to face them again on future runs and you get to keep their boons, too.Speaking of masochists, those of you who really want to risk it for the biscuit can take on CURSED HOLES! You’ll often find these at crossroads when you’re navigating the map in between holes. One route may have a pick-up and a standard hole, while the other will offer you extra goodies and a skull covered hole at the end of it. These cursed holes mix things up by triggering random modifiers every few shots. These ‘curses’ could include making your ball extra bouncy for a couple shots, restricting you to only be able to shoot in one direction, flipping the course upside down, and other pesky hindrances to your game. Beating a cursed hole will earn you extra cash and a card booster pack. In Golf Purgatory the saying is true – with high risk comes high reward.A course chock full of randomized dungeon-like holes, sneaky death traps, challenging bosses, and wicked curses; jeez does Golf Purgatory ever throw a lot at you. Well, if you make it past all of that to the 16th hole, you’ll be in HELL. Prepare for the ultimate challenge here. I won’t spoil what awaits you in Hell, but let’s just say it lives up to its namesake. Prepare to use all your golfing skills, Ace Card abilities and boons to survive Golf Purgatory’s last bastion before ascension. No golfer has ever managed to make it past here before, will you be the first? Only one way to find out, pick up Cursed to Golf on PS5 or PS4 today!\\nDid you like this?\\n\\nLike this\\n\\n \\n\\nShare this storyJoin the ConversationBut don't be a jerk!\\n\\tPlease be kind, considerate, and constructive.

       " \"Meet the four-legged cast of Them’s Fightin’ Herds, out October 18\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe developers break down the herd of seven playable characters in this 2D fighter.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThem’s Fightin’ Herds (more lovingly called “TFH”) is a 2D fighting game developed by Mane6, a small team working hard to create an experience both newcomers and veterans of the genre will enjoy together. On October 18, players from around the world can finally join the stampede and play the game on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 for the first time.In the mysterious and magical world of Fœnum, all manner of four-legged hooved creatures form societies, develop culture, and train for battle. Different regions and species in Foenum have elected champions to quest for a magical key with the power to lock the Predators away, all while earning glory and prestige for themselves and their own kind. Only one will be found worthy enough to wield this key, and the competition is fierce!\\xa0Them’s Fightin’ Herds is a four-button fighter with Light, Medium, and Heavy attack buttons plus a Magic button to access a character’s unique abilities. Multiple attacks in sequence form combos, which are typically done by going from Light to Heavy then from Ground to Air.\\xa0Special Moves are executed by performing an attack after a complex directional motion, like in traditional fighting games. Similarly, Super Meter builds during a fight, which can be spent to perform powerful Super Attacks.Chain together normal attacks, extend your combos with special moves, and finish off your opponent with highly damaging Super Attacks to win the round!Every character approaches combat in their own way, representing a mixture of archetypes familiar to fans of fighting games.Playstyle: Rushdown // GroundedDifficulty: EasyArizona is the youngest daughter of Texas and Minnesota, Head Bull and Cow of her cattlekind clan, nomads who roam The Prairie in search of greener pastures and open sky.Despite her size she possesses immense strength for kickin’, stompin’, and headbuckin’ opponents into submission. Her trusty lasso helps her continue combos and catch them unaware!Playstyle: ZonerDifficulty: MediumVelvet hails from Reine City, the posh center for Fœnum’s elite. She might not have much experience outside the city walls, but her talent and smarts keep her in perfect form regardless.No deer can hold a candle to Velvet in the practice of Winter Magic. She commands sharp icicles, frozen wind, and fancy dance moves to prevent opponents from getting close and spoiling ze floof!Playstyle: All-RounderDifficulty: MediumOleander was born deep in the secluded groves of The Woodlands among practitioners of Light Magic, but her frustration over the other unicorns’ indifference to the imminent Predator invasion drove her towards a darker path.Oleander has formed a pact with a demon known as FHTNG TH§ ¿NSP§KBL? (Fred for short) and now practices Dark Magic. Her varied Special Moves allow her great flexibility, but she must gain power through her Magic ability before she can use most of them.Playstyle: All-Rounder // TrickyDifficulty: MediumAlpacas live high up in the mountains among the ruins of a past civilization. The harsh environment turns most of them into grim stoics, but Paprika is a rare exception. She has a lot of love to give. Maybe too much. If only she could find somebody to give it to. Anybody. She’s not picky.Paprika thrives on chaos: zipping across the stage in the blink of an eye, tossing gifts from her picnic basket to distract opponents, all while setting up her powerful strikes and grabs.Playstyle: Puppet // SummoningDifficulty: HardPom never wanted to be a champion, but the pack of sheep dogs who’ve taken a liking to her seem to sense some hidden potential and urge her along despite her sheepish attitude towards danger.Pom calls upon and commands various types of these sheep dogs for her attacks. With practice, players can use her abilities to strike from unexpected angles and apply heavy pressure to their opponents.Playstyle: Rushdown // AerialDifficulty: EasyTianhuo is a Longma (half-dragon half-horse) and the captain of the royal guard in a proud nation of elite warriors sworn to protect the people of Fœnum.\\xa0With finely-honed martial arts and deadly flame, Tianhuo dominates the skies. Quick attacks and high mobility help players get in, stay in, and keep them guessing.Playstyle: Rushdown // RunstopDifficulty: HardShanty is a young orphan from the Goatani Islands on a journey to prove herself worthy of joining a legendary pirate crew. She’s aiming big – her heart’s set on stealing the most valuable treasure in the world: that magic key everyone’s talking about!Using her Magic ability, Shanty can run at high speeds across the stage and even up walls to rush down and literally walk all over the competition!These seven characters make up the base roster for TFH, but more challengers are on their way. Gallop through an episodic story mode or jump into the action online and find your favorite when it launches this October 18.\\nDid you like this?\\n\\nLike this\\n\\n \\n\\nShare this storyJoin the ConversationBut don't be a jerk!\\n\\tPlease be kind, considerate, and constructive.

       " \"Blazing Chrome creator returns with Vengeful Guardian Moonrider\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJoyMasher talks crafting the sci-fi aesthetic of its new ‘90s-style action platformer.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHi everybody, I’m Danilo from JoyMasher and I’m super excited to tell you more about Vengeful Guardian Moonrider, our next big game! And believe me, it’s quite a ride.After tackling the run ‘n’ gun genre with our previous game Blazing Chrome (inspired by timeless classics like Contra), I wanted with Vengeful Guardian Moonrider to keep the retro goodness of ‘90s action-platformers while updating the experience in fun new ways.For that, I dug deep into the territory of 16-bit games and even some early CD games, and tried to craft an authentic experience, just as if you just found in your basement an unreleased MegaDrive/Genesis game. For that, I for example used redbook style audio and even recorded speech in order to give Vengeful Guardian Moonrider an authentic feel of this era.But games were not our only inspiration for Vengeful Guardian Moonrider and I also tried to mix many different cultural influences I had during my childhood, playing amazing Japanese action games, watching dark anime and reading speculative and questionable pulp science-fiction novels. Genocyber, Cybernetic Guardians, Kamen Rider Black, and Hakaider were all rewatched to help chisel the type of universe in which Vengeful Guardian Moonrider takes place. Rewatching all those amazing shows was of course very serious work and not at all an excuse to spend some great quality time, hehe…\\xa0All the character designs in Vengeful Guardian Moonrider, and general art direction of the game, were heavily inspired by Japanese artist Keita Amemiya, the designer behind lots of video games, anime, and tokusatsu from that era. I also took a lot of inspiration from H.R. Giger, the artist behind the otherworldly visuals of the Alien series.Most of the enemies have lots of biomechanical parts and have a very creepy feeling to them. The boss rooms’ backgrounds also have their share of body horror and organic elements, giving another good layer of that creepy feeling I was looking for while keeping a very cool look to them! I was also very much influenced by yokais (japanese demons) and their depiction in traditional Japanese art.As you must have guessed by now, references are very important to me and a great source of inspiration, and I think they were mandatory to get me to the proper mindset for creating a horrific sci-fi atmosphere you would like to explore. Everything in Vengeful Guardian Moonrider is harsh, dark, and moody, but not without reason. The story is also a dark tale about an alternate reality where an oppressive state uses its weapons – the guardians – to subdue other nations and its own people. Moonrider is a guardian that, after an incident, decides to fight for its people and destroy the evil regime.We know that there are lots of action-adventure indie games around, however, we’re trying really hard to create something special, something that replicates the feeling of the action-adventure games of the 90s while bringing a new edge to it. The atmosphere is of course a great tool for that, but the gameplay is also fundamental.\\xa0Vengeful Guardian Moonrider is an old-school action platformer, but we tried to make a mix of fast arcade style with a little bit of item hunting and exploration with the Chip System, giving you new abilities and powers during your playthrough. For instance, there are power chips that can grant you double jump, weapon range extension, HP regeneration, and lots of other useful abilities, allowing you to really choose and to play the way you want to.And that wraps it up for this blog post! I hope you’re as excited as us about Vengeful Guardian Moonrider and hope you will enjoy it as much as we’re enjoying making it. Stay tuned for more retro love and keep an eye out for Vengeful Guardian Moonrider, coming to PlayStation.\\nDid you like this?\\n\\nLike this\\n\\n \\n\\nShare this storyJoin the ConversationBut don't be a jerk!\\n\\tPlease be kind, considerate, and constructive.

       " \"Only the strong survive — how Amicia and Hugo’s abilities will change in A Plague Tale: Requiem\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDiscover how the siblings have been impacted by the events of the first game and how their gameplay has evolved in the sequel coming on October 18.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHi everyone! Kevin Choteau here, Game Director at Asobo and very excited about everything we’ve been working on to bring you A Plague Tale: Requiem! The game releases on October 18 on PlayStation 5, three years after its prequel, Innocence. So time has passed, and so has it for our two heroes, Amicia and Hugo, who we’ll meet in Requiem six months after we said goodbye to them in Innocence. They’re both children, subject to constant evolution, so you can expect them to have changed! And that’ll impact how you play with them… Let’s look a bit into it right now.Hugo and Amicia have had to evolve a great deal, and to evolve fast to face the trials that life puts in front of them. They’re confronted with the extreme cruelty of their time, and experience atrocities and events that are far bigger than them. So their personalities and their abilities evolve in the process. Amicia learns to fight and to kill, and Hugo learns to use his power. And that does not strictly involve physical skills, it also means to deal with the morality of their actions and the trauma such amount of violence may cause.\\xa0Following the events of Innocence, Amicia’s more hardened in combat. This is made clear by looking at her new set of weapons, which not only includes an improved version of the sling she was using in Innocence, but also a crossbow—a weapon of war.Hugo was really just a spectator at the start of Innocence, discovering the world and marvelling at everything. But he becomes active as he becomes aware of the danger: he has an extraordinary power that he started using at the end of Innocence, and he continues down that path in Requiem.So our two heroes have matured, and they are prepared for action. But it’s a lot to ask two children, and assuming these roles means developing a sense of darkness. That will be part of how they can use their abilities: weighing their actions and how much darkness they let in will be key to making it through.Learning to control herself will be one of Amicia’s main challenges. Her trauma resurfaces and she has to deal with how far she can go to protect her brother. Her struggle to learn and accept to use force and to kill can lead her to develop a taste for it. Requiem constantly puts her in the position to question the limits of survival and protection instincts. She’s moved past hesitation, but the risk for her to sink completely into violence is real.This internal conflict comes in a context where threats get wilder. In Innocence, the opponents were the Inquisition and English soldiers, quite organised. In Requiem, Amicia and Hugo will face mercenaries and smugglers, more violent and unpredictable. Our team has put a lot of effort into designing their intelligence and reactions to each situation. Their potential of adaptation to Amicia’s moves will truly challenge players!Amicia will need to control this risk of escalation, and that will be made possible by the agency given to players in approaching situations and solving them. The array of tools she can use will broaden, with new alchemical recipes, her improved sling and a crossbow. But more importantly, a whole new spatial dynamic will be introduced.Amicia is going to rely heavily on environment-specific resources and make it her strongest asset. She’s going to develop guerrilla approaches to surprise and harass their opponents, using what is available in the environment to her advantage, from tarpots to slow enemies down to ignitable tall grass. In terms of gameplay, this translates into much more open encounters than what we had in Innocence, fitting the much bigger environments introduced in this new chapter. That means danger can be approached in more than a single way, in a context where there is plenty to explore. You can make up your own mix of alchemy, stealth and action—using a knife in hand-to-to hand combat if it has to come to it! Not only does this allow to avoid escalation if done well, but it allows for the evolution of Amicia and Hugo, from a more vulnerable survival attitude to increasing confidence in facing enemies.Hugo’s supernatural power perfectly represents the duality between their children’s souls and the enormous stakes he and his sister become responsible for. There is a vertiginous dimension brought forth by the rats which is an essential aspect of the game: there’s this gigantic, unstoppable force, it’s scary but it has to be fought to survive.The risk of Hugo losing control while fighting it makes it all the more intimidating. We got to witness it in Innocence, and it becomes an important threat in Requiem. He could destroy a whole city…! We are reaching a scale of threat and awe that wasn’t possible at the time of Innocence.Psychologically too, there’s an important impact to resorting to his powers: Hugo gets to share the perception and the feelings of the rats… Every time he does, it damages him a bit more. That impacts the player’s experience as well and teaches them to be cautious. At the same time, there is a certain vicious pleasure in unleashing this power… but consequences follow and a price is to be paid! It’s a story of moral dilemmas, with the progression of the Macula and the lives of people Hugo holds dear at stake.I hope you’re as excited as me to play Amicia and Hugo’s next chapter! Our team has still so much to share with you in the lead-up to the release, so stay tuned for more! A Plague Tale: Requiem releases on October 18 on PlayStation 5. You can pre-order it now to get exclusive bonuses.\\nDid you like this?\\n\\nLike this\\n\\n \\n\\nShare this storyJoin the ConversationBut don't be a jerk!\\n\\tPlease be kind, considerate, and constructive.

       " \"Blue hair and pronouns in I Was A Teenage Exocolonist, out August 25\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCrafting a fictional world by representing the best parts of this one.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSpeculative fiction often turns the lens back on the reader, making the previously unknown become knowable by turning it into story.It’s long been used as a vehicle for representation, from Star Trek exploring new frontiers of romance, to Octavia Butler positioning a Black woman at the forefront of humanity’s escape to space in Parable of the Sower, to dystopian YA like The Hunger Games tapping into every young woman’s desire to change the world by burning it down.I’m Lindsay Ishihiro, and as the narrative designer of I Was a Teenage Exocolonist, I’d like to tell you about the ways our game follows in this tradition, breaking new ground in how players represent themselves and their gender, sexuality, and relationships in a video game.I Was a Teenage Exocolonist is a genre-spanning game about growing up on an extrasolar colony: part life simulator, deck builder, roleplaying game, and dating simulator. You play Sol, a child whose parents – unhappy with their life on a dying Earth – flung themselves into space intending to create a new human culture from the ground up on the planet Vertumna IV.Given absolute freedom, what do a group of idealists preserve from human cultures, and what do they reject? And what do they accidentally bring with them, despite their best intentions?Exocolonist’s simple character creation system hits far above its weight class. There are only two questions: what are Sol’s pronouns, and will they grow to appear masculine, androgynous, or feminine?Even the UI to select Sol’s appearance is a slider instead of three buttons, giving the player a chance to say their Sol is ‘just a little’ masculine or feminine.They/them is included in the standard pronoun selection, but players who prefer a more bespoke experience can teach it to use their correct pronouns and other gendered terms. In space, anyone can be fae/faeself.You can even change their pronouns and appearance at any time, no gender-changing items or cursed springs required.Sol’s anatomy is set later, during puberty – but there’s even an option for Sol having no reproductive anatomy at all, thanks to futuristic medical technology. Anatomy being separate from appearance and pronouns allows for a huge spectrum of possible genders, encompassing cis bodies, binary and non-binary trans bodies, and gender-nonconforming bodies of many kinds.Even teenage exocolonists have to sit through cringe-inducing lectures in school. Sorry, space teens!Sol wasn’t the only child born in space; nine other children grow up alongside Sol, all of whom (plus one more) are potential friendships and love interests.Let’s get what I consider the bare minimums out of the way: I Was a Teenage Exocolonist is proud to feature transgender and nonbinary characters and includes same-sex, asexual, aromantic, and even polyamorous relationships.With a diverse team, we knew that in order to tell a story about the richness of the human experience we needed to be radically inclusive in our characters and the way they interact with the player and each other.And they do interact with each other! Sol’s friends fall in love, hurt each other, undergo their own tragedies, and even die. Sol is a part of their stories; you choose how important a part you play.Sol becomes closer to their friends by giving them gifts and saying the right things, of course, but also by being the kind of person they’d want to be friends with. Working alongside them, sharing their political opinions, and getting involved in their stories will bring them closer, just like in real life.Also like in real life, friendships can blossom into something different.I Was A Teenage Exocolonist has unique triggers for all relationships. Yes, some still need ten hearts before they’ll give you a kiss, but others are happy to make the space beast with two (and sometimes three) backs while you’re still getting to know each other. Some characters need you to step up at a critical time in their life to feel comfortable opening up to you. Some need to finish their life’s work first. Some naturally prefer to date other people, so getting them interested in Sol requires extra effort.Thanks to the weirdness of the wormhole, Sol will relive their teenage years over and over, learning from their mistakes and helping humanity find its place in the stars. You’ll be many Sols, over many lifetimes.Accurately representing the player in I Was A Teenage Exocolonist is integral to the experience of being Sol, giving them the sense that their unique self is important to humanity as a whole.\\xa0It was vital to telling a story about finding oneself, literally, at the very forefront of humanity’s most collective action.\\xa0I Was a Teenage Exocolonist is coming out on PS4 and PS5 on August 25, 2022.

       " \"A deeper look at the gameplay and soundtrack of Serial Cleaners\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tZip up your windbreaker and hop on your station wagon - it’s time to cover up crimes to the rhythm of the many music genres of the 1990s, out September 22.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe story of Serial Cleaners begins on New Year’s Eve 1999. Bob and his fellow cleaners, Psycho, Lati, and Vip3r, meet at the back of a funeral home to reminisce about the past. It’s a nostalgic trip to the early 1990s at first, but as recollections continue, strange inaccuracies continue to pile up, exposing long-held truths they have been keeping from each other.Each character has their own story to tell. Your choices throughout the night will slowly alter how they tell that story and ultimately decide how their shared story ends.While keeping its narrative legacy intact, in Serial Cleaners we greatly expand on the ideas of the original game, Serial Cleaner. Instead of presenting the player with simple puzzle-like stages, we decided to present them with a set of tools and abilities to choose from – and improvise. Let your imagination run wild, and you will surely find your own way to cover those pesky crimes!Whether you want to sneak or sprint through the level, drag the evidence around, or cut it to pieces, we have you covered. The game becomes much more open-ended with a wide range of contextual interactions and more involved law enforcement. While the overall complexity increases, the heart of our original game – wiping the scene clean – is still there and feels better than ever.Four different cleaners means four unique perspectives. While Bob relies on his good ol’ tricks of the trade, adjusted and enhanced with the new environment in mind, we bring to the game three new and distinct playstyles. There is Psycho’s brute force, Lati’s agility and awareness, and Vip3r’s cutting-edge tech skills. Each mission is tied to one of the cleaners and unfolds a piece of their turbulent story over the decade.Choosing the ‘90s as our timeframe opened a door into a unique zeitgeist for us. The eccentric Basquiat-esque street art mixed with our fresh spin on cult crime thrillers, Tarantino classics, and B-movie action films allowed us to portray the ‘90s as the decade as it was back then – full of brightly colored optimism… and the grime underneath it all.It’s only natural that all of this should come with a proper soundtrack. There is this crude ‘90s punk nonconformity, the sound of many genres that defined the end of the last century – from East Coast hip-hop, to industrial metal, and a sea of electronic music. From Beastie Boys and Wu-Tang Clan, through Orbital and Prodigy, finishing with Nine Inch Nails and Ministry. Each of the cleaners represents a part of that musical tapestry, which makes their respective music scores uniquely theirs.Such an eclectic aesthetic required someone with a deep-tissue level of understanding of what made the sound of the 1990s what it was. That is why we teamed up with the amazing Joshua Eustis (Telefon Tel Aviv, Nine Inch Nails, Puscifer, and others).What made Joshua’s work really magical was his idea not just to riff on existing well-known tracks, but to try and recreate the ecosystem of musical styles rooted in the subcultures of the 1990s. Styles that were all related and influenced each other in exceptional ways, resulting in a varied, distinct, yet unmistakable aesthetic of the decade – one Josh was uniquely qualified to reproduce since, well, he lived it.\\xa0Serial Cleaners is a bizarre crime story with a cheeky twist on a wise-guy fantasy. When cleaning up after NYC wrongdoers, you get a glimpse of the sins ingrained in the city’s tissue. But what does it matter? You are a professional, one of the best of the trade. You’re here to solve problems. No matter the case, no matter the cost.Isn’t that right?Serial Cleaners launches on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on September 22.\\nDid you like this?\\n\\nLike this\\n\\n \\n\\nShare this storyJoin the ConversationBut don't be a jerk!\\n\\tPlease be kind, considerate, and constructive.

       " \"Story details you need to know before playing God of War Ragnarök\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFelicia Day and the Smartest Man Alive, Mimir recap the story thus far in the Myths of Midgard.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGod of War fans were introduced to a new side of Kratos when God of War launched on PS4 in 2018. If you haven’t yet experienced the tale of father and son traveling the realms of Norse myth yourself, or if it’s been a while, we’re ready to catch you up to speed.To prepare for the upcoming release of God of War Ragnarök on November 9, we’ve invited two of the best storytellers we know to recap the journey of Kratos and Atreus from God of War (2018): the amazing Felicia Day and the Smartest Man Alive, Mimir!\\xa0The new Myths of Midgard video is an animated storybook recounting the events of God of War (2018), with a goal of catching you up on the previous game.\\xa0Before you watch, beware – there are spoilers ahead!\\xa0Of course, the best way to experience God of War (2018) is to pick up the Leviathan Axe and leap in yourself (available with PlayStation Extra and Premium membership plans*). You can also pick up the God of War (2018) Digital Deluxe Edition for $9.99 USD during the PlayStation Store Summer Sale through August 17.Hungry for an even deeper summary of God of War (2018)? Keep reading for a full recap.Our story begins with an end, the funeral of Faye – mother to Atreus and wife of Kratos. Her last wish imparted to her family is to scatter her ashes on the highest peak in all the realms. This request begins a journey that forces father and son to work together as they face the dangerous Norse wilds filled with beasts, monsters, and less-than-friendly gods.\\xa0\\xa0Kratos, despite trying to leave his bloody past as the Ghost of Sparta behind, is still haunted by the man – the god – he was. His relationship with Atreus has been distant, stern, and disciplined. Now coping with the death of his wife, Kratos must learn to be the father that his son needs so they can both survive their journey across distant realms to lay Faye to rest.\\xa0\\xa0Atreus is a young boy dealing with the sudden loss of his mother and a cold, distant father. Despite being sickly as a child and only very recently recovering enough to travel, Atreus wants nothing more than to fulfill his mother’s final wish and prove to his father that he is strong.\\xa0Having been taught by Faye how to use a bow and hunt, Atreus hopes that he can show Kratos he will be an asset on their journey and that he is no longer the frail boy he used to be.\\xa0After the funeral of Faye, Kratos and Atreus are visited by a mysterious stranger – one who seems intent on picking a fight with the legendary God of War from a distant land. Baldur says he is sent by Odin to investigate the home and its residents, indicating that perhaps he, and the rest of the Norse Gods, are much more aware of Kratos’ past than even his own son.\\xa0They clash, tearing through the earth and rock surrounding the home in a bloody brawl that reveals Baldur has lost the ability to feel anything – impervious to pain and pleasure alike. Though the battle is close, Kratos is able to harness his rage and finally beats Baldur into submission. While he has rid them of the immediate threat, Kratos realizes that his home, and his son, are no longer safe. They must make the journey now – whether Atreus is ready for it or not.\\xa0Thinking that they are looking for the highest peak in Midgard, Kratos and Atreus journey towards the tallest mountain in their realm.\\xa0Along the way they meet the Huldra Brothers, Brok and Sindri, who are renowned dwarven smiths. While the brothers are dealing with some familial tension, both Brok and Sindri provide their assistance and services after seeing that Kratos wields the Leviathan Axe, a weapon they had personally forged for their friend and Kratos’ late wife, Faye.\\xa0They also encounter the mysterious Witch of the Woods, who offers them her aid including knowledge of how to use the Bifröst, a magical tool that allows father and son to traverse between the Nine Realms. The Witch is later revealed to be the Vanir goddess Freya, mother of Baldur and exiled wife of Odin.\\xa0As Kratos and Atreus are finally able to reach the peak with Freya’s guidance, they arrive to see Baldur already there, flanked by two hulking accomplices, Magni and Modi – the sons of Thor. They spy the Aesir gods interrogating a man who has been fused to a tree, though they quickly leave after receiving little from the evasive prisoner.\\xa0Mimir, once an ambassador and advisor to Odin, is the self-described Smarted Man Alive and currently being punished on suspicion of betraying the All-Father.\\xa0He reveals that while our heroes have made it to the highest peak in Midgard, they have not yet reached the highest peak in all the realms. Their true destination resides in Jötunheim and will, by all accounts, be rather hard to get to considering all entry has been blocked.\\xa0Mimir knows of another way, but first gives Kratos the pleasure of decapitating him and pleading his case to the Witch of the Woods to magically revive his severed head so he can be free of Odin’s prison.\\xa0\\xa0Finally learning of Freya’s godhood, Kratos distrusts her as he distrusts all of their kind. After reviving Mimir, she advises Kratos to tell Atreus that he is part god, just like his father. Freya warns that denying his son’s true nature will only bring the boy pain.\\xa0Ignoring her advice – Kratos, Atreus, and the freshly revived Mimir set off to find the tools needed to open a passage to Jötunheim.\\xa0Along their journey, the trio are ambushed by the two men they saw accompanying Baldur, Magni and Modi. They battle Kratos and Atreus fiercely, though Kratos is able to strike a killing blow on Magni.\\xa0Modi flees, but later finds the pair again. By killing Kratos, he hopes to regain his honor and prove that he is worthy of Thor’s legacy. Modi subdues Kratos, but seeing his father in peril, Atreus instinctively triggers what appears to be his own Spartan Rage ability.Not knowing his own godhood, Atreus is overwhelmed by the sudden surge and falls unconscious, his childhood illness seemingly returned and worse than ever. Kratos fends off Modi, who quickly departs knowing his life is in danger. Seeing that Atreus is barely alive, Kratos takes his son to Freya in the hopes her magic can help save his son.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Freya reveals that Atreus’ sickness is caused due to the conflict between his nature as a god and his ignorance of that fact. She believes she has a treatment that can wake him but requires the heart of a creature in Helheim, the realm of the dead.Knowing the frost-attuned Leviathan Axe will be of little help to him in the frozen wastelands of Hel, Kratos returns to his home and retrieves a part of his past he had hoped to leave behind – the Blades of Chaos.\\xa0The Blades were once a tool of fiery bloodshed and a symbol of Kratos’ servitude to the Greek gods, many of which he killed in his life as the God of War. Knowing they are the key to saving his son, Kratos chooses to acknowledge his past for the sake of saving Atreus and equips the Blades of Chaos once again.\\xa0Kratos successfully retrieves the heart for Freya, allowing her to save his son. After he regains consciousness, Kratos reveals to Atreus their true nature as gods.\\xa0Despite Atreus’ illness fading with this secret now in the open, the boy grows increasingly arrogant. Modi finds the pair again, desperate to try and finish them off to regain a scrap of respect from Thor. Badly beaten by his father for failing to kill Kratos and letting his brother Magnai die, Modi proves to be little threat. Atreus stabs the weakened Modi in direct defiance of Kratos’ order, killing the god once and for all.\\xa0Seeing that Atreus’ newly revealed godhood has caused his son to become increasingly cruel and arrogant, Kratos knows he must teach his son to be better before it’s too late.\\xa0Having gathered the tools to make a portal to Jötunheim, Kratos, Atreus, and Mimir return once again to the peak of Midgard to travel to the realm of the Giants.\\xa0As they arrive, they are ambushed by Baldur. Instead of following his father’s directions and jumping through the just-opened portal, Atreus, in his arrogance, tries to fight Baldur alone.\\xa0Kratos intervenes, but during his clash with Baldur, the portal to Jötunheim is destroyed. Baldur incapacitates and captures Atreus when the boy tries to attack him single-handedly again and takes off towards the Lake of Nine. Kratos follows, their battle eventually leads to the Realm Travel Room, where Baldur attempts to take them to Asgard. At the last moment, Kratos diverts the Bifröst to another realm instead, Helheim.\\xa0In the realm of the dead, they are faced with specters of not just Kratos’ past, but Baldur’s as well. While father and son overcome the trials of this frozen realm, they discover the source of Baldur’s invulnerability was a spell cast by his mother.At the time of his birth, Freya had learned that her son was fated to be killed. To prevent any harm coming to Baldur, she casts a spell to protect him from all magical and physical threats. Despite Freya’s mastery of the art, Vanir magic is notoriously slippery and hard to control. The spell had a single weakness she could not prevent, Baldur would not be impervious to mistletoe.\\xa0As Baldur grew, the effects of the spell became clear. While the god was invulnerable to everything, it also rendered him completely numb – unable to feel pain, and all of life’s pleasures too. Even though he begged Freya to undo the spell, she would not for fear of the prophecy coming true and her son dying. Baldur grew to hate and resent his mother for denying him the ability to feel.\\xa0After Baldur’s relationship with Freya and the truth of his condition is revealed, Kratos and Atreus escape back to Midgard having reconciled and made amends to each other following the events of Modi’s death and Baldur’s attack.\\xa0After the destruction of the portal to Jötunheim, Mimir shares one last solution: they can try to get to the realm of the Giants. Before they can attempt it, Kratos and Atreus are attacked again by Baldur who also escaped Helheim, but this time Freya intervenes.\\xa0Incensed by his mother’s arrival, Baldur seeks to kill not only Kratos and Atreus, but finally exact revenge on his mother for the spell placed on him at birth.\\xa0Having worked together over the entire journey across the realms, father and son now fight in unison. Together they push back Baldur, only to see Freya once again try to stop the fighting by subduing Kratos. As Baldur moves to strike a finishing blow, Atreus protects his father, placing himself between them which causes the Aesir god to punch the mistletoe arrowhead Atreus kept as a binding for his quiver.\\xa0With the arrowhead impaled through his hand, the spell finally breaks and Baldur, for the first time in his life, is finally able to feel everything – the pain of an injury, the cold snow below his feet, the sun on his face.\\xa0Reveling in the new sensations, Baldur recommences his attack with a mad vigor – relishing in all the feelings he had never been able to experience before.\\xa0They fight again, but through their shared strength, Kratos and Atreus are finally able to beat the newly vulnerable Baldur, who demands they kill him and end his life while he is still able to feel. Freya pleads with them to spare her only son, and Kratos relents – knowing all too well the pain a parent feels at losing a child.\\xa0As they turn to leave, Baldur uses his remaining strength to try and strangle Freya as payment for his years of numb torment. Freya accepts her death, hoping it will give her son some semblance of peace in his life to know she’s gone.\\xa0Kratos, seeing his own bloody mistakes about to be repeated by Baldur, steps in to save Freya’s life by killing her son. Unable to accept his death, Freya cradles the dead body of Baldur while swearing vengeance upon Kratos for taking away her only child, even if it meant that she would live.\\xa0Finally able to make the journey to Jötunheim with the help of Mimir’s Bifröst eyes, Kratos and Atreus reach a Giant temple – one that has their entire journey carved into the walls. The Giants had seen what would come to pass, as well as what had come before.\\xa0They discover that this was all left for them by Faye, who was a Giant herself – a secret she had kept from her husband and son. Atreus finally uncovers the full truth of his heritage, that he is not only part god and part mortal, he is part Giant as well.\\xa0Atreus had two names, one was given to him by his father and the other, his mother. The name Faye had bestowed upon him was Loki.\\xa0Together Kratos and Atreus scatter the ashes on the peak of Jötunheim, finally fulfilling their quest.\\xa0As they return home to Midgard, Mimir warns them that the death of Baldur means that the first event said to mark the arrival of Ragnarök has come to pass.\\xa0\\xa0Kratos and Atreus now find themselves at the center of a prophecy that has foretold the complete upheaval of the Nine Realms and a battle so great it results in the deaths of many Aesir gods including Odin and Thor.\\xa0Father and son will have to choose their path as the freezing winds and snows of Fimbulwinter envelop their home in Midgard.\\xa0\\xa0—–\\xa0Discover the rest of the story yourself when God of War Ragnarök launches on PS5 and PS4 November 9, 2022.For the latest updates around God of War Ragnarök, make sure you follow Santa Monica Studio on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.*Game library varies over time, region/country and plan.

       " \"SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake announced\\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Brand new spiritual sequel to fan-favorite remake Battle For Bikini Bottom: Rehydrated.\\xa0\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAre you ready, kids? SpongeBob returns to the screen in a new fantastic adventure! SpongeBob and Patrick are traveling to a multitude of different Wishworlds, each with its very own setting and rules, like the Wild West Jellyfish Fields or the Halloween Rock Bottom. On the THQ Nordic Showcase we just revealed gameplay for the first time.What was the elevator pitch for the game?Let’s create a brand new spiritual sequel to our fan-favorite remake Battle For Bikini Bottom: Rehydrated. A 3D platformer focused on themed worlds, funky costumes and the buddy banter between SpongeBob and Patrick. Focusing on SpongeBob, as he travels the Wild West, medieval or prehistoric times and more, was always at the core of the game vision. And the idea of having Patrick be your constant companion, in the form of a cute Balloon, was also there right from the very beginning.Was it always certain a sequel was on the cards?\\xa0\\xa0Greenlighting a new project in the world of SpongeBob is a collaborative process with our very supportive friends at Nickelodeon, who know the franchise in and out and make the final call. Ultimately the success of Battle for Bikini Bottom: Rehydrated, and the passionate support of its fans is what allowed us to send SpongeBob and Patrick on another great adventure!\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0How does the game evolve or change the gameplay from the previous title?\\xa0\\xa0Battle For Bikini Bottom had three playable characters: SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy. Each with one or more special abilities. For The Cosmic Shake we decided to focus on SpongeBob and giving him a lot of new abilities, like a flying karate kick or being able to roll around on big rocks. Unlocking dozens of cult classic costumes for SpongeBob is also for the first time a core focus in a SpongeBob game. Whether you want to run around as a knight in shiny armor or just in your underpants: it’s up to you!And last but not least, the themed worlds. SpongeBob inadvertently messes with the very fabric of the universe, when playing with a vial of wish-fulfilling Mermaid’s Tears. As a result Patrick is turned into a balloon, and our heroes have to travel to weird Wishworlds to bring back their friends and restore Bikini Bottom. Whether it’s bringing back Sandy from a karate-movie themed Downtown Bikini Bottom or rescuing Pearl from the medieval Sulfur Fields… every world is unique and has its own distinct story.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Can you describe the gameplay levels that you can see in the showcase trailer?In the trailer you get a first look at multiple worlds that SpongeBob and Patrick travel to in the game. It starts with the boss fight against a giant Gary in Halloween Rock Bottom. Then we join our heroes searching for Squidward in the Prehistoric Kelp Forest.

       " \"Alone in the Dark returns\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tReimagining of the classic survival horror is coming to PlayStation.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tExperience the franchise that defined the survival-horror genre and pathed the way for classics like Resident Evil and Silent Hill – yes, we’re delighted to let you know that the reimagining of Alone in the Dark is coming to PlayStation 5! A technical marvel when it first launched in 1992, Alone in the Dark set the standards for immersive horror adventures to come. Developer Pieces Interactive is returning to the franchise’s roots in terms of setting while updating and reimagining the game for a new generation of players.You can get a feel for what’s in store in our haunting new trailer. Hold your nerve as viewer discretion is very, very advised…\\xa0\\xa0To do justice to such a seminal title in video game history, we’re proud to say there is a stellar lineup of talent involved. Developers Pieces Interactive is a mix of hot new talent and seasoned veteran developers. An engaging story has been created by Mikael Hedberg, cult horror writer of SOMA and Amnesia: The Dark Descent, some of the most acclaimed narrative horror experiences of the last decade. Legendary Guillermo del Toro collaborator, Guy Davis, has contributed monster designs. And Doom Jazz legend Jason Köhnen provides eerie and haunting melodies to create a tense, twisted and haunting audio atmosphere.\\xa0In Alone in the Dark, you’ll experience a completely original story, but it does incorporate characters, places, and themes from the original ’90s trilogy. No prior knowledge of the original titles is required to enjoy the game, but fans of the series will find plenty that is familiar.Our Alone in the Dark is set in the gothic American south during the 1920s – a noir setting with classic Lovecraftian horror elements. It’s a world where the familiar meets the surreal. You’ll revisit an expanded and transformed Derceto Mansion, the location that featured in the 1992 game, and various other sites connected to Derceto too. Both Emily Hartwood and Edward Carnby, the original game’s protagonists, are playable, but all enemies are new, original creations. Although there are some nods to monsters from the past…\\xa0The game features classic survival horror gameplay, as you’d expect. You’ll explore environments, solve puzzles, and experience a deep psychological original horror story. You’ll also experience hyper-tense action and combat as you battle supernatural monsters. We aim to create a game that takes advantage of modern gaming technology to reimagine so much of what makes the original great while pushing things forward for a new Alone in the Dark experience on PlayStation 5. We can’t wait to reveal more.\\xa0\\nDid you like this?\\n\\nLike this\\n\\n \\n\\nShare this storyJoin the ConversationBut don't be a jerk!\\n\\tPlease be kind, considerate, and constructive.

       " \"Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered swings onto PC today\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Nixxes discusses the technical and artistic process of adding ultra-wide support \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHi everyone, I’m Julian Huijbregts, Community Manager at Nixxes. Today we celebrate the launch of Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered on PC!In the past year, our team has been working closely together with our friends at Insomniac Games to bring this original Marvel story and PlayStation hit to PC. To give you more insight into the support for ultra-wide monitors and multiple screen setups*, I’d like to introduce you to some of the members of our Nixxes team.Graphics Programmer Hilze Vonck, a passionate ultra-wide screen gamer himself, worked on the technical implementation of ultra-wide aspect ratios in the PC version of Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered. “For five years I have used a 21:9 ultra-wide monitor. To me support for ultra-wide resolutions in games is really important. We want to give gamers who invest a lot in their setups the opportunity to play the game in the best way possible. It really makes a big difference when you see the game on ultra-wide or triple monitor setups. It is super cool to experience the game in this way!”Lead Software Engineer Coen Frauenfelder explains that one of the reasons to go all-out with ultra-wide monitor support was the positive feedback from the gaming community on 21:9 support in other PC games. “We initially planned support for 21:9, and after some internal tests we decided to go even wider and add support for 32:9 screens and 48:9 for triple monitor setups. The game lends itself very well for that. Swinging through the streets of Marvel’s New York on an ultra-wide screen gives a whole different and more immersive feeling.”The PC version of Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered is fully optimized for ultra-wide gaming. Not only the gameplay, but also the many cut scenes are adapted for panoramic aspect ratios up to 32:9. Coen talks about the challenges that Nixxes had to overcome, to make this possible:“Implementing ultra-wide support in general gameplay is relatively easy. The big challenge is supporting it in cinematics that are specifically designed by artists to be viewed on 16:9 screens. Outside of that view area, lots of things are happening that need to be fixed. Characters can for example freeze or suddenly disappear. The easy way would be to place black borders in cut scenes to block these areas from view on ultra-wide screens, but we wanted to give PC gamers the possibility to fully use their screens. Our QA team meticulously went through all the cut scenes in ultra-wide view and listed all the details that had to be changed by our engineers and artists.”Coen emphasizes how hard it was to get all of that right: “We knew it would take a lot of effort to pull off, but our team was passionate and committed to get the most out of it. Hilze’s enthusiasm towards it meant he got to work a lot on the technical aspects of implementing ultra-wide support.”As a result, cinematics in Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered on PC are fully viewable in aspect ratios up to 32:9. When using even wider aspect ratios, for example with triple monitor setups, the outer edges are blurred during cut scenes. This is necessary to block areas from view that otherwise may have visual errors. Apart from his work on the engine for ultra-wide support, Hilze also worked on this: “That was not an easy feature to implement. It took a while, but I think it looks really great.”Outside of gameplay and cinematics, system engineers at Nixxes made sure that the user interface and menus support wide-screen aspect ratios. When using ultra-wide monitors, you can change the position of the HUD to different positions.We know that not all of you have ultra-wide screens or multiple monitor setups. On traditional 16:9 screens the PC version of Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered also offers many enhancements. The game features enhanced ray-traced reflections**, supports NVIDIA DLSS and other upscaling technologies, and offers a full suite of customizable rendering settings.Everyone at Nixxes has been incredibly excited to work on this project together with our friends at Insomniac. We would love to hear about your experiences playing the Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered on PC. Reach out to us on Twitter and follow us to stay up to date!Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered for PC is available today on Steam and in the Epic Games Store.*Compatible PC and display device required.**Compatible PC required.\\nDid you like this?\\n\\nLike this\\n\\n \\n\\nShare this storyJoin the ConversationBut don't be a jerk!\\n\\tPlease be kind, considerate, and constructive.

       " \"Prepare for Rollerdrome with dev combat tips, out August 16\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMaster Kara’s arsenal and tap into Super Reflex Time to win top prize in the thrilling bloodsport.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRollerdrome is a fast-paced bloodsport which will have you balancing gnarly skate tricks with high-powered firefights against the deadly House Players. To help you achieve maximum impact when you enter the Arena on August 16, I spoke to some of the devs who helped build the game and got the lowdown on the combat system.\\xa0There are four types of weapons in Rollerdrome, which you’ll unlock throughout the game:Combos are achieved by eliminating enemies in quick succession. Swapping back and forth between weapons allows you to capitalize on the benefits of multiple weapons while maintaining a combo. Try blowing the doors off a Mecha Brut with a well-placed grenade before closing in and finishing it off with the shotgun. You can also shoot your own grenade with the pistols, ensuring it detonates near a specific enemy. You can even use the detonation to change direction mid-air, though you will also take damage – so use this technique sparingly! Use Slug Shots to stun-lock enemies, and then finish them up with a quick barrage from the pistols before they have time to teleport away or shield up.And remember: it’s not just your own weapons at your disposal. A savvy player will be able to press enemies into using their attacks against each other (or even themselves).One of the key mechanics you’ll need to utilize in Rollerdrome is Reflex Time. You can access Reflex Time by pressing L2 – but use this carefully, as Reflex Time only lasts for a few moments before needing to recharge. In Reflex Time, you’ll experience a brief moment of slo-mo gameplay, which is a great opportunity to use the rapid-fire pistols and stun-lock your enemies.\\xa0In Super Reflex Time (which you can access by perfect dodging just before you enter Reflex Time), you get a noticeable power boost – this is a great time to use pistols at short range, or the Z-11 for further away foes. While most of the time you’ll access Super Reflex Time by dodging enemy attacks, you can also trigger it by dodging through your own grenade launcher’s explosions – enabling you to activate it on your own terms, without waiting for the enemies to attack.Out of ammo? It’s time to do some tricks. In Rollerdrome, ammo is acquired by performing skate tricks, so you’ll need to focus on that as well as on taking out your enemies. The best bang for your buck comes from mixing up and chaining together tricks – you can do this by stringing tricks together with wallrides, grinds, and grabs. Try using Reflex Time while in the air mid-trick to get a good scope on an enemy and take them out in style. Using a variety of tricks, rather than just the same ones over and over, is key to getting maximum ammo, so brush up on a bunch of different styles and make use of them wherever you can. If balancing keeping your combo up and taking out enemies at the same time is proving tricky, you can also grab the floating yellow Combo Tokens to keep your combo going while you pull off a few quick tricks for a bit more ammo. Then it’s time to eliminate your enemies and emerge victorious.Rollerdrome is available August 16 on PS4 and PS5.Huge thanks to our amazing devs Bartosz Rakowski (consultant), Dan Gronner (lead QA tester), David Jenkins (head of QA), and Jacob Mills (senior 3D level designer), who offered their advice and insight for this article.\\nDid you like this?\\n\\nLike this\\n\\n \\n\\nShare this storyJoin the ConversationBut don't be a jerk!\\n\\tPlease be kind, considerate, and constructive.

       " \"How Capcom designed Kimberly and Juri for Street Fighter 6\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe developer dives into character design details for the newly announced fighters.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFresh off the streets of Evo 2022, two more characters have been announced for Street Fighter 6, the next evolution of the Street Fighter franchise, launching in 2023. Juri returns with her playfully sadistic ways along with new ninja Kimberly! We sat down with Game Director Takayuki Nakayama to ask him how Kimberly and Juri were designed along with quick bios for the duo.\\xa0Bust out some beats and shake up your spray cans to welcome the newest ninja to Street Fighter 6. Kimberly invited herself to become Guy’s student, who is the 39th Successor to Bushinryu after defeating his master Zeku, the 38th Successor. Kimberly had an ordinary upbringing, but she’s a prodigy who graduated college early and now wants to be a full-fledged ninja. She is infatuated with ’80s pop culture when the portable cassette player was at its peak popularity, hence why she always carries one with her.Takayuki Nakayama: In terms of Kimberly’s design, we aimed to create an outfit suitable for her speedy and acrobatic movements since she excels in sports like track-and-field and cheerleading. Pair her brightly colored gi with sneakers suitable for moving around quickly, and you have Bushinryu-like ninja attire, don’t you think? We tried to make her hairstyle and outfit beautifully showcase her striking silhouette since she is an expert at running and airborne attacks. The spray can and portable cassette player on her waist are also used for special moves.The music she listens to originates from a certain person, but you will have to wait for the story to find out who that is. Let’s see how Kimberly, the Ninja + Pop Star = Ninja Star, performs.\\xa0\\u3000According to Nakayama, Kimberly’s arsenal of techniques make use of her high physical strength and allows her to open up opponents in various ways. Being a spunky new ninja, Kimberly incorporates an urban twist to reimagine what Bushinryu means to her. She uses Genius at Play to stock up on a spray can, which can then be thrown to the ground as a Shuriken Bomb. During Hidden Variable, Kimberly conceals herself in colorful smoke before instantly appearing in front of an opponent for a surprise attack. Finally, she has the trademark ninja Sprint, which can be followed up with kick options or Arc Step where Kimberly launches herself off from the opponent.First appearing in Super Street Fighter IV, Juri remains a sadistic thrillseeker who enjoys the suffering of others, taking immense joy in obliterating her foes. Previously, her main motivator was revenge against M. Bison, but since his fall in Street Fighter V, she now whittles away her time in a gloomy haze. What lies in store for her now?Takayuki Nakayama: For Juri, this costume retains the image from her Super Street Fighter IV one, but has been rearranged to fit the Street Fighter 6 aesthetic. There is also a change in the hairstyle, which I think gives it extra personality.Underneath her jacket, black tape that imitates the appearance of a spider covers her body. The colors of her Feng Shui Engine are purple, black, and white, and accented with emerald green. Also, please pay attention to her helmet, as you may have seen in the trailer when she appears on her motorcycle, since it matches her design. Her smart phone also reflects her personality and style, don’t you think?Fans of Juri will be wickedly pleased to know she retains many of her past moves with different properties now. Fuhajin returns where Juri performs an upwards kick and stores Fuha stocks upon completion. Saihasho, Ankensatsu, and Go Ohsatsu are newly named special moves, but may be visually familiar in the form of the low projectile or jumping axe kick. While these can now be performed without having to expend Fuha stocks, they can be chained together and powered up if a Fuha stock is available.Finally, Juri’s Shiku-sen, a flying dive kick, returns from Super Street Fighter IV, which can be followed up with a series of flashy airborne kicks. This opens up more creative options for Juri’s playstyle and can catch an opponent off guard.\\xa0If you missed it, Street Fighter 6 has a new Real Time Commentary Feature where notable names in the fighting game community lend their voices to commentate your matches. Previously, Vicious and Aru were revealed to be the first two Play-by-Play Commentators back in June. Now, we can confirm two more legendary commentators.\\xa0First, we want to go into more detail on the Real Time Commentary Feature. In tournaments, there are usually two commentators working in tandem: the Play-by-Play Commentator, who specializes in describing the action with articulate and rapid delivery, and the Color Commentator, who gives further insight and analysis into the match. We mirror this concept in Street Fighter 6 where you can select both a Play-by-Play Commentator and a Color Commentator in the settings!Joining Vicious and Aru as a Play-by-Play Commentator is Tasty Steve, who brings his trademark energy, charisma, and hype to his performance. Our first Color Commentator reveal is no other than the fighting game historian, James Chen. We’re honored to have these two legends be a part of Street Fighter 6 history and can’t wait for you to hear them in-game. We’ll reveal more voices in the future!This completes our Evo 2022 announcements. We’re excited to have Kimberly and Juri bring their unique personalities to the character roster while James Chen and Tasty Steve lend their voices to Street Fighter 6. We’ll see you later in the year for our next reveals!

       " \"How Rollerdrome’s composer created the sound of 2030\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSoundtrack creator Electric Dragon shares his thoughts on developing a new sound for the dark retro-future in Rollerdrome, out August 16.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRoll7’s upcoming skater-shooter, Rollerdrome, features a fully original soundtrack, featuring dark retro-futuristic synth beats by the incredible Electric Dragon. I spoke to Ian, the artist behind Electric Dragon, to discuss the process of working on the project and creating this all-new album.Jemima Tyssen Smith: Hello Ian! I had the pleasure of working with you while you created the incredible all-new music for Rollerdrome. This was such an exciting project for Roll7. What was it that drew you to the project?Electric Dragon: You summoned me!Haha – it’s true! Yes, I was actually the first person to reach out to you – we initially wanted just the one track, right?Yes, that’s just it – I didn’t know the full details of the game at the time, but what I saw was super interesting to me, and I actually offered to do some original work at that point. After that I had a meeting with some of the team and we talked through what was needed in more detail. I’d been in a rut with the album I was working on, and talking to the folks at Roll7 really gave me a burst of inspiration. I think it just all came together really well for everyone involved, actually. I’d always wanted to work on a game soundtrack, and Rollerdrome is an incredible game to be involved with.I think when you spoke about the possibility of original tracks that felt perfect for us since we wanted such a specific vibe to the soundtrack. Could you talk a bit about that?Yeah, so the energy we were after was a soundtrack with the power of synthwave but a distinct 70’s flavour. It felt like it might be quite tricky to balance as we really wanted to avoid going too disco as well – the game has a darkness to it that needed to be echoed in the music. In the end it actually came together quite naturally, though. I basically tackled the soundtrack as if it was sort of from the angle of the 70’s looking forward – very BBC ‘Tomorrow’s World’, you know? And then I was inspired a bit by lots of different things really: 70’s pioneers like Vangellis, Wendy Carlos, Philip Glass, Giorgio Moroder, Tangerine Dream… lots of inspiration from lots of places!Seeing all of the cool kit you have is so inspiring – it’s all really interesting stuff. What was it that drew you to music and to synthwave in the first place?I used to have a Commodore 64 as a kid, and my uncle bought me some software for that which was called ‘Utilisynth’. It was very complicated, but I managed to make some awesome wibbly-wobbly noises, and from there on I was sort of hooked! I went on to play guitar, I DJ’d house music in the 90’s, I was even in a death metal band for a bit… but in time I returned to synth.And we’re very glad you did! This project is obviously quite different to working on an album that’s not attached so closely to a game and a concept – how did that work for you?Yeah, since the tracks need to fit with the gameplay I couldn’t really do breakdowns in the same way I might have done on a totally free-form album, so that was a really interesting challenge to work around. I also needed to strike a balance between the dystopian narrative and the thrilling gameplay – the tracks needed grit, but they also needed a sense of fun in there, too. I think those moments of positivity really help make the dark parts of the game darker, which I really like. One thing I did love about the process – and this might seem silly – is that the narrative really helped me to pick track titles. I always find naming tracks a bit tough, so it was a real relief to have content already there to pull titles from!Lastly, I have to ask – where does the name ‘Electric Dragon’ come from?It’s from a 2001 Japanese film – Electric Dragon 80.000 V. It’s about two rivals who get electrocuted and then end up with superpowers… and they also play seriously guitar-wrecking solos.That sounds so cool! I’m adding it to my watch list as we speak. Thank you so much for taking the time to chat to me today and for making this epic soundtrack. I just can’t wait for people to experience it in-game.Me neither!Rollerdrome is coming to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 August 16.\\nDid you like this?\\n\\nLike this\\n\\n \\n\\nShare this storyJoin the ConversationBut don't be a jerk!\\n\\tPlease be kind, considerate, and constructive.

Exciting news straight from the goat’s mouth, Goat Simulator 3 has a launch date! Pilgor and friends will be crashing onto PlayStation 5 November 17.\\xa0We’ve heard that a lot of people are getting confused by the naming of our game, Goat Simulator 3. Here at Coffee Stain Publishing we wanted to set the record straight and answer the question of why it’s called Goat Simulator “3”… Unfortunately we’ve not managed to get a straight answer from our friends over at Coffee Stain North, the creators of the game. Which isn’t totally surprising as they are a bit of a strange bunch.But in the spirit of transparency and since you asked, here’s what we were told by various members of the team, we’ll let you decide what to think.\\xa0\\xa0What we do know is that Goat Simulator 3 is officially coming out on November 17 and you can pre-order the standard edition now on PlayStation 5 here for a jiggly ‘pre-udder’ surprise or pick the Digital Downgrade Edition which comes with a selection of remastered items from Goat Simulator.\\xa0We’ve also revealed a special collector’s Goat In A Box Edition (currently available for pre-order in EU and ANZ regions only) for the ultimate goat enthusiasts. Pre-order now and you’ll get your own little Pilgor toy to cuddle or keep in pristine condition in the attic and hope it will become valuable someday (Warning: It won’t).Sorry again for the lack of clarity, to make up for it we’ve got a couple of new exclusive screenshots from the game in the hopes that you’ll forgive us <3Aggressively assert your own personal style, whatever the occasion.When you feel the need – the need for speed, Goat Simulator 3 has you covered.\\nDid you like this?\\n\\nLike this\\n\\n \\n\\nShare this storyJoin the ConversationBut don't be a jerk!\\n\\tPlease be kind, considerate, and constructive.

       " \"The realism of FIFA 23’s new motion capture technology\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFIFA 23’s HyperMotion 2 motion capture system allows the game to be more true-to-life than ever.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFIFA 23 is on the way, and EA is not only looking to make it the most expansive title of the series to date but the most realistic as well. To do this, EA has upgraded its HyperMotion motion capture system to HyperMotion 2 and improved its machine learning algorithm. Both tools capture and put together data to make virtual football as authentic as possible. Said data even comes from actual football matches by the team in Zaragoza, Spain, shot on Xsens technology. All this works together to create the most visually authentic entry in the series thus far.FIFA 23 utilizes Advanced 11-v-11 match capture, meaning that actual football players came together for full-on matches using Xsens suits. This year’s game draws from two matches featuring professional teams, including a women’s match (a series first). That capture was then combined with EA’s new machine learning algorithm to make players and the environments around them more lifelike.Various visual and mechanical enhancements further amplify FIFA 23’s faithfulness to the sport. Players’ limbs now react to the impact of the ball, and fully-3D nets even move when the ball or players make contact with them. Other extra touches like new animations and (over 500) chants for crowds liven up a match’s physical and emotional energy.\\xa0HyperMotion 2 and the new machine learning algorithm have a hand in various innovations coming to FIFA 23’s gameplay. EA presented several features made possible thanks to this innovative technology. Full Team Authentic Motion ensures that no two plays are identical. Star-specific run styles, improved technical dribbling, female athlete-specific animations, and left-footed skill moves are now made possible with these advancements. Now more than ever, football matches look and feel more like they do in real life.\\xa0More detailed and more authentic animations lead to more depth and control in the game itself.\\xa0 For example, Power Shots are a new skill-based risk-reward mechanic that unlocks yet another layer of strategy. To use them, you must carve out the perfect space and aim precisely, pressing L1 and R1, then shoot to activate. If performed correctly, you can score goals with more power and accuracy. However, the longer animations and the need for precision introduce a higher risk.Defensive areas of the game aren’t left out either. You can lie down behind the wall to block low shots. The new motion capture data also allows players to perform clearance slide, physical, and back heel tackles, which aggressively counter offensive abilities, such as added shooting types like chesting, backspins, and downward volleys. There are even more ways to pass, including the always smile-inducing bum bumping.\\xa0EA is aiming for authenticity with FIFA 23, and every piece of the game is building toward that goal. You can experience this true-to-life football title when it releases on PlayStation 4 and 5 on September 30.\\nDid you like this?\\n\\nLike this\\n\\n \\n\\nShare this storyJoin the ConversationBut don't be a jerk!\\n\\tPlease be kind, considerate, and constructive.

       " \"Gran Turismo 7 July Update 1.19 delivers three new vehicles to Legend Cars and Brand Central\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThree new legendary cars are added, including the Nissan Skyline Super Silhouette Group 5 ‘84.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGran Turismo players! The July update for Gran Turismo 7 arrives today July 27 at 11:00pm PDT* (June 27 at 7am BST / 3pm JST).\\xa0An extraordinary Skyline that stood out in races of the 1980’s.The Skyline Super Silhouette is one of the most iconic cars from this series, with a look that is far from ordinary to say the least. Sporting a chin spoiler that extends far forward of the car almost scraping the tarmac, fenders expanded to extreme levels in both the front and rear, combined with a large rear wing, it was powered by a 2.1 litre 4 cylinder turbocharged racing engine called the LZ20B. Often spitting flames out of its exhaust located just below the left hand door, it was an incredible presence on the track that completely mesmerized car enthusiasts and race fans of its day.A beautiful streamlined 2-seater sportscar that won the Gran Turismo Trophy.Every August in the U.S., the most beautiful cars from throughout all of car history are gathered for the world famous Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance. The 2014 winner of the Gran Turismo Trophy, just one of the awards available, was this Maserati A6GCS/53 Spyder, chassis No. 2078. The A6 was the designation for a series of 6-cyclinder racing cars developed by Maserati from 1947 to 1956. The GCS, intended for sports car championship competition, started out resembling a 2-seater version of the classic cigar shaped grand prix cars. However, after regulations changed in 1953, a number of coachbuilders began to fashion their own designs for the tubular frame.This super sports car is a reinterpretation of the glorious Carrera GT as a plug-in hybrid.The Porsche 918 Spyder is a supercar introduced by Porsche in 2011. A successor to the Carrera GT, production was limited to 918 cars. The most notable aspect of the car is that it is actually a plug-in hybrid. A 599 BHP 4.6L V8 engine based on the engine from the RS Spyder prototype race car is mounted in the mid-ship position with a single electric motor in the rear, resulting in a total system output of 873 BHP. This incredible performance when combined with the optional Weissach Package allows the car to reach 62.1 mph in 2.6s, 124.3 mph in 7.2s and 186.4 mph in just 19.9s. Advertised as having a top speed of 214.4 mph, it was able to set a lap time of 6:57 on the Nürburgring Nordschleife.Be sure to stay tuned to official GT and PlayStation channels as there are plenty more updates to come from the team. Until then, happy racing!* Internet connection required for update.

The cameras will allow you to scan the room, while the PS VR2 Sense controllers allow you to expand and further customize the play area to fit your play style and room environment.While playing, if you get close to the boundary you have set up, you will receive a warning that you are closely approaching the play area boundary. You can modify your settings at any time while PS VR2 is connected. Once you set up your play area, the settings will be saved unless you move into a different play area.In VR Mode, players can enjoy VR game content in a 360 view in a virtual environment. Content will be displayed in 4000 x 2040 HDR video format (2000 x 2040 per eye) with 90Hz/120Hz frame rate.In Cinematic Mode, players can view the PS5 system and UI and all non-VR game and media content on a virtual cinema screen.

Can't see it on the storeInterested in Saints Row but I am waiting for the reviews.Even though it's a bit more grounded than the most recent in the franchise it still looks like it will be a lot of silly not taking itself too seriously gaming fun.I just want to know there are no big technical or performance problems before I pull the trigger.Bleep! Soul Hackers 2 is going to be here already!?I’m not even done with Xenoblade 2 before I could start XC3…. too much JRPG goodness in my backlog….@BBB saw a Reddit post from someone who got the game early so I asked if the plot revolves around a bunch of hipster students that want to pay back their student loans & he said it does 👎🏻Really hope Saints row is good - I need a GTA style open world fix.

Is Still One Of Xbox\\'s Most Popular GamesGuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpSeriouslyBack at the start of the year, we reported on a new Xbox game called \"Who\\'s Your Daddy?!\" that launched into the Xbox Game Preview program at the low, low price of £4.19 / $4.99. Eight months later, that game is amazingly still finding its way to the top of the \"Top Paid Xbox Games\" charts on the Microsoft Store.The premise of the game is that you play as either a Daddy or a Baby - the Daddy\\'s job is to try and prevent the baby from getting into any harm, while the Baby\\'s job is the exact opposite! Here\\'s the official description:Who\\'s Your Daddy?! is a casual asymmetric multiplayer game featuring a clueless father attempting to prevent his infant son from certain death. Play with up to 7 of your friends online (up to 4 player split-screen), and test your parenting skills in a competitive setup with wacky physics and over 67 potentially ominous household items.At the time of writing, it\\'s clocked up just over 2100 reviews on the Xbox Store with an average of 4/5 stars, so it\\'s certainly proving a hit, and the actual full release isn\\'t even expected to take place until December of this year.If you\\'re interested, there\\'s a free trial on the Xbox Store, so maybe give it a go!Have you played Who\\'s Your Daddy?!

When he's not gaming, Ben spends his time listening to way too much Guns N' Roses, watching football and probably eating somewhere.Comments (31)PGR4 is my all time favourite racing game.Forza Horizon. I rest my case. Made me realise how utterly boring Gran Turismo is.Project Gotham 3 and 4 for me with the Forza horizon series a close 2nd never could get into forza motorsport though. Split second on xbox 360 was amazing too.Dirt rally 2.0 is as close to perfection as racing games have come for me, so DiRT gets my vote..No Rallisport Challenge? For shame!Too hard for me as a racing games fan. Split/Second, FlatOut Ultimate Carnage, TDU, PGR... How do I even choose? Going with Forza feels... Basic?So many great racing series on the list, I chose Burnout since I used to play those games all the time.Yes FH winning buy a long shot. So well deserved. Come this November 2022 still the only true top end AAA exclusive title on the series consoles to have released from an Xbox studio. Which on another note is very poor studio management and higher executive management.Hardly a competition, forza Horizon@gollumb82 Forza Horizon is different to Gran Turismo. Comparing GT to Forza Motorsport would be a more fair comparison.I voted Project Gotham Racing, I’ve missed that series and I’m totally burnt out with Forza Horizon. I’d seriously roll my eyes if another Horizon is announced.@gollumb82 I've had many arguments about how boring GT is and the attempted ps4 spin off of GT sport was dreadfully boring and painful. Long live forzaFH for me, specifically FH 2. That said, I think developers seem to think that more, or bigger, equates to better, when (as far as I'm concerned) that isn't the case at all. I think it was FH 3, or 4, that I picked up and played, but just felt so overwhelmed by the content.Gameplay diversity and quality over compactness and quantity, imo.@MaccaMUFC That depends. I like both arcade and sim racing (or simcade if you want to be more specific). In terms of the sheer fun factor Forza Horizon mops the floor with any racer out there. I do like Motorsport as well. My favourite is FM6 and I hope FM8 is more like 6 rather than 7 (especially in the career, soundtrack and overall feel department). I get where you're coming from, though. I had to take a break from FH5 as I got tired of it in time. Still, Gran Turismo 7, which I bought at launch because I liked GT Sport well enough, got boring after 10-15 hours. The worst part if it- the catch up you play in most races. No qualifying session etc. Also, the rigged reward tickets that net you the worst possible reward 90% of the time. In short, Forza is way better, whether you're talking Horizon or Motorsport.I'll never forget you, Midnight Club.Couldn't pick there's a lot of good ones on thereForza Horizon is great, but for me it still hasn’t passed the fun I had with PGR, Burnout and Midnight Club. Even some of the Need For Speeds have been amazing over the years.Horizon all the way. Didn't get 5 yet though, still waiting on a sale.PGR for sure. So many great memories of them games.I don't like racing games ...apart from one,burnout paradise the only car game I've ever been able to get Into for some reason and I loved it it so much I had to do it all over again on the remasterI’ve got so many great memories of the first Test Drive Unlimited. At that time, it seemed like a totally new experience and concept. So many times I’d just randomly pick up someone’s tail and just follow them, overtaking, then over taking me etc.I really enjoyed Forza Horizon 4, really connected with that game. Forza Horizon 5 on the other hand, couldn’t stand it! So much confusion on the map, online community ***** that I didn’t care about. I’m not expecting much from the next Horizon game.PGR. Bring it back and remind everyone.Assetto Corsa Competizione with the caveat that you are playing on a series X (it's rough on the S and they stopped supporting last gen.)In terms of the driving and racing experience it blows everything else out of the water once you are in the actual race.It helps if you can find an organised league which do pop up if you look.While there is no doubt it's 100% better on pc it getting better on the series X with each patch. Wish 505 pushed them out quicker and were better a communicating about progress.I really wish we had more actual sim racers on current gen. I think the X has the capability and I can't be the only one who wants to see something like rFactor or Automobalista 2 make the jump.Simcade games are ok as far as they go and a decent stepping stone we just need more full sim options to complete the step.Not all that into driving games, but I liked the one with the Geometry Wars machine in the garage. I played that more than the game.@Eleventy8 I have the same memories of Test Drive Unlimited. An open-world racer seemed so magical at the time, years before FH and The Crew would emulate it. Test Drive Unlimited walked so FH could run.Easy, Forza Motorsport, I bought my Series S only to play that game, sad that is not releasing this yearGarfield Kart, obviously.Loved PGR but if I had to choose between it or Forza Horizon, I’d have to go with FH. I’ve probably spent more time playing FH games than anything else in my console gaming lifetime.FH is a different beast that is unmatched.I chose TDU. Forza was simply too obvious of a choice, and PGR was great but TDU felt the most special to me.An obscure hidden gem reference I would make: Import Tuner Challenge, an old Xbox 360 exclusive, which was actually the final game in the Tokyo Xtreme Racer series.Outrun is not in the poll!

       " 'id Software Says It\\'s Hard At Work On Its \\'Next Big Game\\'GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpWhat could it be?It\\'s QuakeCon this weekend, and apart from sales and new game announcements for Xbox\\'s PC Game Pass, there\\'s also been some updates about id Software.At the very beginning of the show, Marty Stratton confirmed the \"next big game\" from id Software was currently in development. It\\'s not exactly a surprise, but it seems to be an official announcement of sorts.Unfortunately, the team isn\\'t ready to share any details just yet. Here\\'s exactly what he had to say:\"Here at id, the team is hard at work on our next big game...although we are not ready to share those details quite yet...\"id Software most recently released DOOM Eternal in 2020, followed by a few expansion. And today, it\\'s also finally launched the free-to-play PC game Quake Champions.What would you like to see next from id Software? Comment down below.[source twitter.com]About Liam DoolanWhen he’s not paying off a loan to Tom Nook, Liam likes to report on the latest gaming news and admire his library of video games. His favourite Nintendo character used to be a guitar-playing dog, but nowadays he prefers to hang out with Judd the cat.Comments (32)Please be Quake.This seems to be the story with Xbox this gen: company X is hard at work making a game we will probably see at the end of this gen... I got a Series X again for Starfield and Hellblade 2, but all I\\'ve played on Xbox this gen are mostly X360 and Xbox One games. Well that and a few indies on Game Pass.Should port quake champions to the Xbox I tried playing it on my pc but it won\\'t run it@gollumb82 It is a bit like Xbox came to the race track with the best car with the best features in my opinion but forgot the petrol to run it. I know each company has the odd quiet year games wise but Xbox are pushing their luck now and when they do release these big AAA games they best be extremely good else I think my Xbox days will be numbered.Actually coming this November 2022 new AAA exclusive game wise we seem to be worse off than the Xbox one. I don’t think the Xbox one ever had a whole year without at least one big AAA exclusive from an Xbox studio. Begs the question how the hell did Xbox let that happen.A new quake would be awesome@Dezzy70 I couldn\\'t have put it any better. I started this gen with Xbox and got a PS5 somewhere along the way. Gotta say that the PS5 is primarily for Sony so-called exclusives because as a console the Series X is better in many ways IMHO. Still, no games means that I\\'m playing the waiting game. It\\'s even worse as I\\'m not a fan of Halo or Gears (I do love Forza Horizon and Motorsport). Fingers crossed for 2023 which could be a breakout year for Xbox with Starfield, Forza Motorsport 8 and maybe Stalker/Hellblade 2. We\\'ll see, but I\\'ll stick with Xbox for BC games if nothing else (PCs are for work as far as I\\'m concerned).@Dezzy70 They let half of their good studios go and thought they could coast by with just the big IPs and passive income from being the \"media centre\". Obviously a dumb strategy.I think they are struggling in these years in particular partly because of covid, but also, all their studios, legacy or purchased, were all just releasing, or had just released their latest title.After this year, there should be a more stable flow of games. They\\'ll have the in house studios to support the flow, and they\\'ll be starting to wrap up their new projects. All they have to do then is spread out the releases.@gollumb82 Cancel my comment about leaving Xbox I don’t think I ever can being honest. See I like Halo, Gears and Forza I was there at the start and can’t get enough. I want a massive new Gears and some Halo campaign DLC and of course have FH5 All third party games I play on series x. Hopefully 2023 will be a great year Xbox wise. I think Sony will have a quiet 2023 compared to 2022, don’t think Spider-Man 2 will make it 2023 and don’t think they will have another big AAA from their studios ready. I maybe wrong.@Richnj Totally agree with you there. Yes they need to learn to spread their big AAA releases, a bit like Sony have done this year 2022So next year 2023 Xbox should be able to do that. Though we have no release dates yet for Starfield and Redfall, looking forward to Redfall as I like fps and vampires and Arkane Studios.I mean it\\'s not like they are going to say \"Well we are just sat here doing nothing\". Of course they will be working on somethingI will pay more attention when they say what the something is and even more attention when it has a solid release date.If the past year has taught me anything it\\'s to not be excited for anything until it\\'s got a solid release date and even then temper that excitement till maybe a week before release in case of delays.I\\'m hoping it\\'s a new Ip instead of another doom.Not because doom is bad or anything but just because the same Studio making the same game all the time every gen can get a bit stale, I like it when Studio\\'s mix it up and create new ambitious ip\\'s like guerilla did when they moved on from Killzone.Same can be said about a lot of studios as well, time to give uncharted, far cry a rest and try something differentThe development times for games seem to have stretched out more and more. The entire Mass Effect trilogy came out over 5 years. If they started making it now I’d bet against my living long enough to play the whole trilogy.Xbox needs successors to Gears and Halo. New IPs that will be system sellers. STARFIELD is a good example if the game turns out to be good but more new IP is needed. Whole new experiences.@UltimateOtaku91 \"just because the same Studio making the same game all the time every gen can get a bit stale\"Haha, 343i.Seriously though. I agree. iD are also too good to waste to place them on autopilot like that. Doom, Wolfenstein, Rage are all in good places from a design POV. They could do with either one release a generation, or left with third party devs to continue. iD either needs to refresh Quake or get a new IP out.\"Killzone\"Coincedentially, I went back to Killzone HD last night to do my Rico/Hard run and finally got my plat on it. I have to go through the other Killzones again, but I\\'m going to try plat Resistance 3 first (already done superhuman, so it shouldn\\'t be too bad). I miss these franchises. I don\\'t care if it\\'s sister studios being opened up or third party devs being asked, but I\\'d love for them to come back. I\\'m totally ok with derivative and budget entries in to older franchises.I\\'m betting a pretty penny that it\\'s H-Doom 2, I can feel it.@Richnj CoD is easily to blame for the end of Killzone, Resistance and SOCOM. Sony got the CoD marketing and timed exclusivity deal in 2015 then following that they released 0 FPS/TPS games.Sony\\'s right when they say CoD is in a league of its own but they are to blame for that. What Sony did was the equivalent of if Microsoft killed off franchises like Halo and Gears in 2009.For the love of God, and all that is holy. Quake 1 reboot.@Clankylad Exactly this. Maybe people forget that Sony takes 4yrs+ between games with their Studio\\'s. Ghost of Tsushima released 6yrs after Infamous Second Son, Horizon:Zero Dawn was nearly 5yrs after Killzone Shadowfall and took 5yrs to make a sequel. GT7 released nearly 5yrs after GT Sport and Turn 10 have needed over 5yrs to make a brand new Forza Motorsport - something that used to take 2yrs.New Game Engines (like Unreal 5) may help reduce development times, but that only released (officially as \\'production ready\\') a few months ago. I\\'m sure its \\'compatible\\' with UE4 when moving game development across, but those games would not be built the Nanite/Lumin advantages of UE5. Therefore, there is going to be \\'work\\' to utilise those if they want to use them.Looking at \\'individual\\' slices of time throughout a generation can make things look \\'much better/worse\\' for a specific platform. After R&C released in June, the \\'next\\' Sony made exclusive to release was Horizon Forbidden west. I know they had some 3rd party exclusives (inc Deathloop) but in that same \\'period\\' MS released MSFS, AoE4, Halo, FH5, Psychonauts 2 and Deathloop. I know that Xbox Console only gamers didn\\'t get to play AoE4 or Deathloop and Psychonauts 2 wasn\\'t \\'exclusive\\', but thats still \\'their\\' studios and still had to make those games.Talking of Psychonauts 2, that\\'s another that\\'s taken a while to develop. They were making that when they joined in late 2018, not even 4yrs ago.People look back on generations \\'differently\\' in hindsight. At the start of the XB1 era, there were comments about Sony\\'s lack of games compared to MS. Then \\'resolution\\' and of course the issues of that disaster of an E3 before, was \\'more\\' important than Exclusives for Sony fanboys - saying that playing BF, CoD, AC4, etc at higher visual quality and/or performance mattered most as more people play multi-platform games. Of course as MS games \\'dried\\' up and Sony started hitting their stride with nearly 3x more studio\\'s as well as buying up \\'Exclusivity\\' and \\'\\'Marketing\\' deals, the rhetoric changed.At the end of the Generation, that\\'s when you can look back and really assess the generation. Xbox gave us a LOT of great things during the XB1 era and implemented a massive shift in its Gaming Business model - merging its small \\'Console\\' division fully integrating it into Microsoft. Xbox ceased to be \\'just\\' the Console and became MS\\'s Gaming brand. Built up their Studio/IP portfoliios, Publishing, Cloud based platform, Back Compatibility Programme, arguably the \\'best\\' hardware of the generation and has started off this generation MUCH stronger.There was a time when people questioned whether MS would sell any Series consoles - especially a discless, weak but cheap Series S. What with having \\'no\\' exclusives (due to day 1 PC/cloud releases) and its \\'only\\' exclusives that \\'sell\\' hardware...@Grumblevolcano I understand and agree with Sony in so far that nothing can compete with COD. It\\'s true. But I also don\\'t agree with their belief that these games had to compete with COD.It was the same criticism I levied against MS with Halo. They tried so hard to shift Halo to beat, or leech off of, COD (which was never going to happen), instead of scaling back Halo to match the Halo community.Apart from being shooter games with online MP, they are nothing alike. There\\'s room enough for all of them. Especially if you dropped the unnecessary MP modes on some. Like, Resistance is better in its co-operative MP than it ever was in competitive MP.@SplooshDmg Trent Reznor or no buy, tho.@UltimateOtaku91 Non-Doom would be nice, but, I don\\'t think a genre change would be it. id is the FPS company...they\\'ve never made non FPS\\'s, ever. Whatever it is, it\\'s an FPS....they invented the genre, everyone else is just a clone.@gollumb82 To be fair, Ratchet & Clank, Kena, and Returnal are the only non-PS4 games I\\'ve played on my PS5, either..... It\\'s ok, there\\'s already too much to play on my PS4 Pro Plus and Xbox One X2..... I like my new video card upgrades. They\\'re machines to play the last 10 years of games on, but make it so they don\\'t suck and run like garbage. @NEStalgia I\\'m ready for id Kart Racing. Choose between Doom Guy, Baron of Hell, Shambler, or even Shub-Niggurath and race to the finish!@gollumb82 The biggest mistake in my opinion is them not starting work on Gears 6 until after the Series X came out. It won\\'t be on shelves until 2026, I\\'m guessing.And what the heck are some of these studios doing? Compulsion Games, some others... I want to see State of Decay 3, Everwild went back to the drawing board... At least they\\'re being held up by their long-lasting multiplayer games such as Sea of Thieves, Grounded, Forza and Halo, when that finally becomes a good game, which is no sooner than 2024 lol. And their Game Pass deals. I can finally play the Persona franchise. Specifically, 3, as I played 4 and beat 5.@SplooshDmg nail packs instead of banana peels, BFG for blue shells. Chainsaw for green shells. This could work!@Royalblues\\nWell said. I don\\'t recall a console launch with basically zero launch games... The Xbox team have done a great job with the hardware, but dropped the ball hard when it comes to software. I mean, I\\'m in a much better position as I\\'m relatively new to Xbox. Series X is my first ever Xbox and I have a lot to play with Fable, Gears and Halo. The Xbox faithful can\\'t say the same. It just seems logical for them to have prepared at least 2-3 killer games for the console launch. 2 years later and all we have is Halo Infinite and FH5 while Sony has Demon\\'s Souls, Miles Morales, Ratchet, Kena, GT7, Horizon FW and soon God of War Ragnarok. It looks bad and even Phil is looking forward to playing Sony exclusives, as pathetic as it sounds.@Royalblues I said a while back, the issue with Xbox isn\\'t necessarily their ability to cobble together a great game. The issue at hand is, it\\'s just hard to consistently count on them to deliver said game. I think in time it will surely get better, but the whole turning over a new leaf with the Series X|S just isn\\'t happening the way it needed too. As gollumb82 points out, for people new to Xbox, there is a lot to catch up on. However, for the Xbox faithful, it\\'s just more waiting like last gen.@Richnj I agree it didn\\'t need to compete with CoD, I was looking more that from 2015 onwards CoD was the shooter franchise for Playstation but if Killzone/Resistance/SOCOM stayed CoD would\\'ve been a shooter franchise for Playstation (still the biggest but just an option).It\\'s like how there\\'d still be plenty of people who would buy Nintendo hardware for JRPGs like Xenoblade and Fire Emblem even if the Pokemon franchise ended with Scarlet/Violet.@SplooshDmg @gollumb82 I think they need to create more division manager positions. People to oversee studios and have more of a firm hand on their output. The pandemic has affected everyone, no doubt, but if you look around, people have still been consistently cranking out games. This kind of thing tells me that many of these studios have had quiet years where they\\'ve not been working on anything, or certainly not their latest releases.@Royalblues You may be onto something here. As much as I appreciate Phil as the leader he may just need some help in keeping all those studios \"hard at work\".@Royalblues While I think there are some issues at hand, I do think there\\'s some truth to the matter that a lot of Xbox studios had released a game right at the end of last gen. Games that just weren\\'t exclusives due to prior commitments. Also, so many coming Xbox games are using UE5. I kinda wonder if that\\'s causing some issues. I mean, it\\'s not like we\\'ve really seen much of UE5 from anyone just yet. Halo was apparently just crippled by ambition that couldn\\'t be executed. So I sorta do wonder if they\\'ve put too many eggs in the UE5 basket by wanting to make these stunning games, and now it\\'s just taking ages to get them out the door.Please be a single player Quake reboot, done in the same gothic/horror style of the first game.@Would_you_kindly apparently it got leaked, I would love to see that too, takes ages to load on my PC then crashes anyway, could also be a resurgence for the gameHe looks like woody Harrison Tap here to load 32 commentsLeave A CommentHold on there, you need to login to post a comment...Two More Games Added To September 2022\\'s Xbox Game Pass LineupAlong with news of a delaySome Notable Titles Are Leaving Xbox Game Pass This Month (August 31)10 in totalNew Lord Of The Rings Game Announced By 2K Publisher Private DivisionExpected to launch 2023-24Xbox Game Pass Is Hurting Right Now, But Larger Forces Are At PlayAll we need, is just a little patienceFour Games Are Confirmed For Xbox Game Pass In September 2022 So FarUpdate: Make that five! 31Pick One What\\'s The Best Racing Series In Xbox History? 9Video Here\\'s A Look At Xbox 360 Emulation On The Steam Deck 14Talking Point What September 2022 Xbox Games With Gold Do You Want? 8News Who\\'s Your Daddy?!

       " 'Wait, Did Xbox Pay $600K For Cooking Simulator On Game Pass?GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpThat seems a lot if trueWe\\'ve never really been privy to the kind of money Microsoft spends on Xbox Game Pass titles, generally because it\\'s seen as confidential information, although we may have received a peek behind the curtain for the new addition of Cooking Simulator.As discovered by Twisted Voxel, a recent financial report relating to developer Big Cheese Studio appears to suggest that the figure might have been around the $600,000 mark, which seems a big deal for a game like Cooking Simulator!It\\'s worth mentioning the report comes from the Warsaw Stock Exchange website, so some details might be lost in (Google) translation. It seems to indicate that the 600k figure is \"approximately 22% of the net profit and approximately 17% of the company\\'s net revenue from the sale of products, goods and materials for the last financial year\".The only other time we\\'ve heard about a figure for a Game Pass game was back in March, when it was reported that Microsoft paid around 5-10 million US dollars to get Marvel\\'s Guardians of the Galaxy on the service.Here\\'s a look at how Cooking Simulator has reportedly grown its player base since joining Game Pass:So, what do you think? Does this sound realistic to you? Let us know down in the comments below.[source gpw.pl, via twistedvoxel.com]About Fraser GilbertFraser has an unhealthy obsession for all things related to Telltale Games\\' The Walking Dead series, and has an intimate knowledge of sports games on Xbox. He also supports Walsall FC – that team in the West Midlands you\\'ve never heard of.Comments (15)I mean, 600k doesn\\'t seem like much. It\\'s a $20 game with an 84% positive on Steam. 600k is only the price of 30,000 retail copies. When you consider there\\'s 25million-ish Game Pass users and simulator games are a pretty popular genre, it adds up to me.Damn that\\'s good money. I wonder how much those single developer games get. Like I wonder how much they paid for Midnight Fight Express. This could be lucrative for single developers, go to game pass via the Xbox ID program.It\\'d be interesting to see what GP makes on average, month by month, to weigh these numbers up against. Either way, that\\'s good money. I wonder how long $600k gets to keep the game on GP for - which is another important factor - months, a year, etc...When you hear stories like this, how many millions they\\'re paying for 3rd party, you really do start to see just how Sony is going to struggle to compete with their subscription services. Can\\'t blame Sony for spending money on marketing rights that end up blocking or delaying gamepass releases...they have to compete. Be frustrated at MS, who have a bottomless well of money, for not being on the ball and getting those marketing rights first.They used to be a lot more aggressive with marketing back in the 360 days. Hopefully PlayStations blocking attempt of the acquisition, and MS perceived frustration of not being able to get certain games on gamepass, will have Xbox more aggressive again when it comes to striking marketing deals.Don\\'t know if 600k is a lot or not for this sort of game to be on gamepass and in all honesty I don\\'t really care.I think folks get too hung up on how much or not something costs Microsoft or Sony or whoever.To me as an end user gamer it\\'s just useless information that has no bearing on the quality or fun of the game in question.They probably added $400k to make sure it never goes on a Sony subscription service. 😄@SplooshDmg Yeah. 600k seems cheap to me too. 25 million subscribers at $10 per month is 250 million per month. They can add 400 cooking simulators and one month\\'s revenue would cover it.@Kaloudz I’d imagine it’s at least 200,000,000 a month. They say they have close to 30,000,000 subscribers by now. Not all are paying 15 bucks for gpu. And some are taking that 1 dollar deal (but since that can only be used once per account those situations are much less now than a few years ago). Assuming they’re making an average of 7 bucks per subscription (not unreasonable) that’d be 200,000,000.@xMightyMatt14x Man that\\'s quite impressive. I expect those prices to soar once the acquisition goes through and more get added to the catalogue.Doesn\\'t seem like that much to me. Maybe for that game in particular as it\\'s a couple of years old but they\\'ve got to make it worth the developers while to make their game free across multiple platforms (assuming it\\'s on pc pass too) world wide.MS is no doubt making money hand over fist from Gamepass too. $600k would be a tiny fraction of their monthly turnover from the service.Either way it\\'s safe to assume that the bean counters at MS know what they\\'re doing.@Kaloudz If they can increase their subscriber count, they won\\'t need to raise prices since they\\'ll be bringing in more money from volume.@NotoriousWhiz True, true. On the other hand, I do ponder how much all their studios cost to run. That mustn\\'t be cheap. Hence why I\\'m surprised there\\'s delays and lack of releases, first party, because that must surely leave a dent?@Kaloudz that is very true. Realistically, with the sheer amount of value we will be getting after the AB purchase and when the new games start getting released (Hellblade 2, Starfield, Avowed, the whole list), I wouldn’t be terribly mad at a price increase. I’d imagine maybe 20 for GPU? Everything is a value proposition so a price increase is probable, but not terrible unless it soars too high too fast, or price goes up before we get the increased volume of AAA games.@xMightyMatt14x Aye that sounds about right. I imagine we will get a gradual increase too, eventually. Obviously MS make money from other platform sales too, but I can\\'t imagine they\\'re too happy that a lot of money gets negated whenever there\\'s a delay.Still, I\\'ll be forever subscribed. I love the service. I just can\\'t wait for the time to come in which there\\'s a steady flow of games. I suspect we will be over this hurdle by 2023.

       " 'Redfall\\'s \\'Expansive\\' Open World Is Arkane\\'s Largest To DateGuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpIt\\'s roomy in hereDuring Quakecon 2022, some of the team at Arkane Studios have sat down to discuss all things Redfall, ahead of the game\\'s early 2023 launch. Most, if not all of the footage in here is re-used from the recent showcase reveal, however, the team\\'s discussion around the game\\'s Vampiric open world is pretty interesting.Arkane legend Harvey Smith says the game\\'s open world feels \"expansive\" yet \"lived in\", and it\\'s also the largest open space the team has created to date. The world is centred around on-foot traversal in Redfall, so it won\\'t be the biggest open world ever, but given the nature of the the game there should be plenty to explore within.The discussion also breaks down the game\\'s vampires and Arkane\\'s approach to developing them. The team wanted to create something \"spooky\" rather straight-up scary, and they even dive into how the vampire attire plays a role in creating that mood.All in all, Redfall seems to be shaping up pretty nicely, and with Deathloop\\'s exclusivity period soon coming to an end, we\\'re pretty hyped to go hands on with two Arkane adventures on Xbox pretty darn soon.Are you liking the look of Redfall? Or does Deathloop entice you more? Leave your thoughts down below.About Ben KerryBen is a fan of action, racing and straight-up shootin\\' in any video game he can get his hands on. When he\\'s not gaming, Ben spends his time listening to way too much Guns N\\' Roses, watching football and probably eating somewhere.Comments (18)I\\'m looking forward to this. The first time i saw it i had the idea it was just another coop shooter like Left for dead and such. But since seeing more and more from it and it being a single player FPS/RPG combination which can be played coop, it keep getting me more and more interested in this game. I cant wait to play this now and that while im not the biggest shooter fan generally.This is the one for me next year. Like Arkane, fps and vampires. Game pass day one. Glad to hear they are putting a lot into the world etc. Just a release date now please.Let’s hope Microsoft advertise the hell out this game and give it some good PR. It’s a new ip AAA looking great so far, they need to get the word out on release etc. one reason Sony does so well is amazing PR even with most new IPs. Then it’s pure word and mouth.The handling of Hive Busters PR was shocking Microsoft could have made that game their Miles Morale equivalent when the new consoles released. Microsoft’s problem is they don’t know how to PR outside of USA and create hype, then no one knows about their big AAA games and IPs.@Dezzy70 I agree, Sony do a much better job at promoting their products. Maybe it’s because they’re mainly a media group whereas Windows basically sells itself. I’ve lost count of the times I’ve seen something that is available on all platforms advertised with PlayStation branding on telly or the side of a bus. I rarely remember seeing something with Xbox branding. Seems a bit of a blind spot, even Nintendo do it better.@Clankylad They used to be good in the Xbox360 era the PR was up their with the best. Let’s hope 2023 they start a really good Xbox consoles, game pass and AAA game advertising PR campaign. The whole Xbox ecosystem really needs it for sure. Momentum in the UK is starting to slacken slowly but surly.I\\'m looking forward to this, it\\'s shaping uo very nicelyI thought this was similar to back 4 Blood and left 4 dead? But it can\\'t be if its open world.Makes me more interested in this now, especially if its doable solo@Retrokingdan Arthur !!!This hasn\\'t been on my radar. Its always been something that I kept an eye on because I like the \\'theme\\' they are going for, but I wasn\\'t sure I\\'d get much out of it due to its seemingly \\'online co-operative\\' game structure.However, as more and more info has come out, especially this video, I am actually beginning to look forward to this. It seems like it will be a Fun solo experience with great systems to tailor your game-play preference that can become even \\'crazier\\' with more \\'characters\\' to combine \\'skills\\'. My one concern still is \\'balance\\'. I don\\'t want to feel I have to rely on \\'others\\' to progress due to Solo damage output and/or enemy counts designed to challenge 3 or 4 players. Scaling the challenge based on player counts is something that I want to see...The more I see, the more its piquing my interest and now I am looking forward to seeing more and/or getting to try it myself...Wish I could get excited for this - and that last pic does look great. Everything I hear about this though sounds like it’s pulling in a lot of directions…yet lacks direction…if that makes sense. It sounds ambitious but nothing I’ve seen looks like it’s nailing anything particularly well. I guess I just don’t know how they will pull off something that was clearly designed for co op as a fulfilling sp game. And how different it will be from the countless other games in the L4D mould. And I love Arkane games…this one just isn’t doing it for me at the moment.@Dezzy70 got to do something since divorcing Olive and gaming is it 😂Still not really sold on this game. I can\\'t tell if it\\'s the actual design or just because the horror \"it\\'s a zombie game but we\\'re going to call them vampires this time\" theme is just not in my wheelhouse.@Clankylad Definitely, marketing is at Sony\\'s core really, and always has been. Like you said, music, movies, and TV are among their core businesses, and those are traditionaly built around 100% pure marketing. They had that know-how by default.Microsoft..... Well, good marketing is how Windows beat OS/2 Warp, unfortunately (remember they were the first company to ever get the Rolling Stones for an ad, Windows \"Start Me Up\" commercial is the reason the far superior OS/2 Warp failed and we\\'ve had Windows ever since.) But since then what have they really advertised other than \"hey, we\\'re here\" type advertising? I remember the Vista ad saturation campaign but that\\'s about it!Inject it into my veins. I\\'ll play anything Arkane, and if this is the closest to a new Dishonored I\\'ll get, then so be it.@Retrokingdan Well you should get out to work on the buses with Stan and Jack 😂@Dezzy70 Totally agree. Their PR can suck, big time. Crackdown 3\\'s PR was outright cringe.On topic, I\\'m actually starting to get a bit excited for this now. I just hope the \"lived in\" statement is true in practice.@Dezzy70 😂😂@Kaloudz I’m looking forward to Redfall as well. As time has gone on, it seems to get better and better with each little bit of detail.@Dezzy70 Yeah exactly. I wasn\\'t sold at first. In fact, I couldn\\'t help but notice how each vampire acted exactly the same in the first gameplay reveal, but as more and more has been unveiled, I\\'m getting pretty hyped.

       " 'Reaction: Death Stranding\\'s Reception Makes Us Very Excited For Kojima + XboxGuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpWe love it when a plan comes togetherSo, it\\'s really happening folks. Death Stranding, Hideo Kojima\\'s latest game, is coming Xbox Game Pass for PC. Sadly, we likely won\\'t ever see an Xbox port for this one (on console it\\'s published by Sony), but the news of its PC Game Pass arrival is getting us real excited for Kojima\\'s proper Xbox project.Back in June, we got official confirmation that Kojima Productions is working with Xbox on a new game. It\\'ll leverage the cloud in some fashion, but beyond that, we really have no idea how this project will take shape. However, given Death Stranding\\'s standout success, we\\'re not really worried about what \\'type\\' of game it\\'ll be.In the run up to Death Stranding\\'s initial launch, in typical Kojima fashion, we saw plenty of downright bizarre promos and trailers about the team\\'s upcoming project. For months no-one really knew what Death Stranding actually was, even when attempts were made to try and explain it.When it did eventually launch in 2019, as it turns out, it ended up being a 20+ hour delivery simulator about big backpacks and even bigger ladders. Yeah, there\\'s a lot more to it than that when you really get into the weeds, but boiling it down, Death Stranding is a \\'walking simulator\\' on steroids, with huge production values and a lengthier runtime.We typically see some reservation whenever a game has \\'cloud-based\\' attached to it - hell, we\\'re all still a little bit scarred from Crackdown 3\\'s attempts to utilise the cloud. However, given Kojima\\'s track record at turning bizarre ideas into very good games, we have no doubt that his Xbox project will come good.For now, we\\'ve just got to play the waiting game. June\\'s announcement post seemed to insinuate that this one is still in its incubation phase, meaning we probably won\\'t get to play it for a number of years. When the trailers begin rolling in closer to launch though, don\\'t expect to understand what the hell\\'s going on. It still might be a tad confusing after you\\'ve played it!In the meantime though, if you have a decent enough PC, maybe giving Death Stranding a whirl will prepare you for what\\'s next. Or maybe not? Either way, it\\'s a very good get for the PC Game Pass library.Will you be playing Death Stranding on Game Pass? Do let us know!About Ben KerryBen is a fan of action, racing and straight-up shootin\\' in any video game he can get his hands on. When he\\'s not gaming, Ben spends his time listening to way too much Guns N\\' Roses, watching football and probably eating somewhere.Comments (44)So the \"walking simulator\" is being received well for PC. Good....One of the few ps exclusives I actually enjoyed...currently enjoying Ghost of Tsunami aswell..I\\'ve still yet to play it on PS5, but I keep hearing good things. Bad ones, too (like the \"walking simulator\" or \"boring game\"). You may not like Kojima for his outlandish ideas or wacky plot of MGS, but there\\'s no denying that his Xbox game will generate a lot of hype from the Xbox crowd and cries of treason from the Sony camp 😎I reckon flight sim, and cloud gaming, has removed a lot of those reservations about the cloud. The potential is huge...but hopefully he\\'ll keep grounded - we don\\'t want a walking sim where you walk around a full scale globe. I\\'m really hoping it\\'s a horror game - one that\\'s released in weekly episodes like a TV show. One that uses the cloud to incorporate current events.Actually scrap that, I really hope it\\'s silent hills...just for the laugh.Tbh though,there\\'s now rumours he may be doing a psvr2 game...now that would be something I\\'d love to play!As I have mentioned elsewhere my overall impression of this game having played it to completion on a ps4 pro was boredom or just a sense of waiting for the fun to startStill if you have PC gamepass and have not tried it elsewhere I would still encourage you to at least try it.You never know it might click for you in a way it didn\\'t for me.This is the main reason I feel that I don\\'t need a PS5. All the games I want to play are either multiplat or the are coming to PC so I can just play them there.@BBB how long did it take you to complete? I played it for around 15 hours and dropped it, it just wasn’t fun. I kept seeing people saying ‘it gets better’ etc but it never did, not in my experience. I wasn’t willing to invest anymore time.I think it\\'s funny that this old game that\\'s been on PC forever already is getting more attention and hype now that it\\'s coming to PC Game Pass than it ever did on PS4, lol.@Fenbops Just checked the last save game and that clocked in at 48 hours and 15 minutes.That was just a story playthrough and not trophy chasing (which is something I rarely do.).I played this while my country was in full COVID lockdown and I do remember forcing myself to keep going. I think in other circumstances I would have dropped it too.Of all the games Kojima was involved with I only ever managed to finish two: MGS2 and Castelvania LOS. And it\\'s definitely not due to lack of trying - there was MGS4 ,5, Snake Eater and even Pace Walker, never hold my interest long enough to finish them.I\\'m curious to see what he is cooking up with his next project regardless.Got to love watching people\\'s minds on Kojima change solely based on the platform he\\'s working on.@NEStalgia more attention & hype?...you must have missed E3 2016 when it was announced@StylesT Ghost of Tsushima is an excellent game and I hope you have a lot of fun with it.If that came to PC gamepass that would be something for folks to be really excited for (though probably will never happen.)@uptownsoul not mine,I\\'m still not a fan of his and I\\'ve played death stranding and got very bored\\nThis is great news for everyone that will enjoy it but I didn\\'tThe thing that gets me is the hell he is getting ,one tweet callls him a (swear word) traitor and told him to remove his tweet about it coming to pc game passWow just wow@uptownsoul No, I didn\\'t miss it. The attention was on Kojima walking on a beam of light (I\\'m back!), and Norman Reedus\\' bare bottom in a confusing trailer that told us nothing about what the game even was. The hype was about what we DIDN\\'T know, not the actual game. When the actual game landed it was kind of a deflation of all that hype.I have a PS4, is this worth picking up? Seems to have provoked a marmite response, but it will only be a few quid to buy.I played this and found it repetitive and boring.@NEStalgia today is just the announcement for Death Stranding in PC gamepass...The apples to apples comparison would be the original E3 2016 announcement.Also if you call Death Stranding launching in top 10 NPD in November 2019 (source: https://mobile.twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1205261069641322497 ) deflated hype, I\\'d like to have whatever potent drink you\\'re sipping on...lol.@NEStalgia and let\\'s be honest...the real reason why this announcement is getting the hype it is...is b/c Xbox gamers want PlayStation games...If this were a typical 3rd party game (like Watch Dog Legions, etc)...it wouldn\\'t have a quarter of the hype...Not my cup of proverbial tea. I do hope that the people who have looked forward to it enjoy it, but from what I\\'ve seen, it takes a little bit more than that to both interest me and impress me.@uptownsoul I agree the hype is fanboy related, but I don\\'t think it\\'s as much about \"Xbox gamers want PS games\" (and in this case, it\\'s PC gamers, not xbox gamers, and Sony gives them PS games officially, anyway, and the game\\'s already been on PC for a long while) as much as just a chance to strike a blow against PS, the enemy!It\\'s not like a platform that didn\\'t already have access to the game for years is getting access to it other than those streaming-only casuals @NEStalgia \"but I don\\'t think it\\'s as much about \"Xbox gamers want PS games\"...You sure about that...b/c this very site had Xbox console gamers complaining that God of War wasn\\'t streamable to Xbox consoles...Sounds a lot like Xbox gamers wanting PS games to me@uptownsoul I remember a thread where people were annoyed that there was specific removal or blocking or something going on surrounding GoW, though I still think it\\'s a similar fanboy kind of thing of striking a blow against Sony, more than actually WANTING to play the game specifically. I\\'m sure some do, but I imagine most that actually wanted to play it played it on a PS or eventually played on PC. Or streamed it on Now. So mostly just internet war cries in both cases....@NEStalgia I honestly just think a lot of it is fanboy nonsense. It\\'s the whole \"Only on Playstation... OR IS IT!?\" thing. Fanboys jumping through hoops to make a game playable on an oppositional console for the sake of no other reason than they can.All that said though, I do think there is some genuine want for games like say, Spiderman. I mean, it\\'s Spiderman. He\\'s only the most popular super hero bar none. So I think there\\'s truth to both sides of this here. Console warriors like to beat drums and I\\'m sure a lot of Xbox players would genuinely enjoy Ghost of Tsushima if it appeared on an Xbox someday.@NEStalgia yeah but the whole \"strike a blow at Sony\" is primarily from Xbox gamers, not PC...And a lot of that wanting to strike at Sony is over wanting the games (or at least wanting the games to be available on Xbox)...FF7, Spidey, for a while Persona 5, etc.The only reason it\\'s getting an article is because it\\'s a ps exclusive on a Xbox/pc service...it\\'s the first game to do that isn\\'t itSimilar to how the baseball game got hype at the timeNothing to do with Xbox gamers wanting the games lolStill think headlines should be changed. Its not coming to xbox gamepass but PC gamepass.@Rmg0731 I had actually thought about this. The name \\'Xbox Game Pass For PC\\' was legitimately retired and replaced with just \\'PC Game Pass\\'. The previous headline is honestly just incorrect.@uptownsoul @SplooshDmg Yeah a bit of both, but let\\'s be real, most of the people beating the fanboy drums own both consoles and played these games years ago @NEStalgia I decided a while ago that I\\'m just an enjoyer of games. I get being a fan of one platform over the other, no harm there. But some of these raging fan boys are as insufferable as political pundits. People arguing over AAA exclusives and minuscule performance differences, and I\\'m sitting over here with a 3080ti playing Quake II, because I\\'m an idiot. @SplooshDmg But it\\'s the highest quality pixels anyone\\'s ever seen in quake 2!@NEStalgia You know, it\\'s honestly kinda wild how well it\\'s held up in 4K. This game was just so outrageously ahead of it\\'s time. It\\'s still a blast to play even today.@uptownsoul don\\'t forget it\\'s also a Kojima game. And it\\'s not like the hype isn\\'t well deserved.Death Stranding is a game I\\'ve always been curious to try but couldn\\'t because I don\\'t own a Sony hardware, and just accepted it wasn\\'t meant to be. Now it\\'s coming to PC Game Pass and I still won\\'t be able to play it because my PC is not good for gaming. I hope they somehow find a way to add it to Cloud Gaming. That would be the only way I could viably play the game.@Cherip-the-Ripper oh I agree...thats why I can\\'t wait to see how they build on things with Death Stranding 2@deadmaker IDK if it\\'s on Game Pass Cloud, but even without Sony hardware, couldn\\'t you just subscribe to PS Plus Premium for a month and steam it on their cloud service on your PC?PS fanboys may make you believe only Microsoft offers streaming, but Sony does too....  (At least for ps1,2,3,4 games.... Not ps5 games.)@NEStalgia fairly certain they don\\'t offer streaming in brazil (yet)@Cherip-the-Ripper oh, that\\'s one of the \"plus deluxe\" zones? That\\'s a shame.I do wish it would have been the \"Directors Cut\" version of the game. But I personally do not have my new gaming rig anywys for the time being.But when I get a new 3090, and already have Game Pass Ultimate thanks to MS Rewards Points. I will give this game a spin.I clearly remember the launch of this game, and just how hyped everyone was for it. Then it comes out.... and lets just say, it did not hit the ground running but more so hit the ground like a sopping wet towel haha. I watched multiple people play it and their receptions were all like \"uhhh what the hell, Where is the game?\" and \"This cut scene has been 20 minutes and shows no sign of stopping\" LOL That is how Kojima games are though... He loves creating these super long cut scenes, he will be making full length movies for the cinema before his career is over 100%.The main game play mechanic of walking while trying to maintain these packages that throw you off balance... that really does seem like it could be a very short lived experience as far as the fun factor. BUTT I could also see the narrative and the community aspect of building things that will show up in other peoples games and visa versa, being a pretty cool and hopefully motivating and compelling thing... I am looking forward to someday seeing how it works with me (but I am not super excited to where I am working hard to get to play the game or anything either)Another great job for the Game Pass team and whoever got this deal to go through. This and MLB The Show has got to PISS OFF SONY execs like no other lol! PlayStation curated content being utilized in Xbox Game Pass in anyway, even if it is just in the PC library, is the last place they want to see content they spent large chunks of investment money in being at.Its pretty sad that an old release ps4 game, thats already been on pc for ages, appears to be getting mindshare from an xbox site?Its not coming to xbox and never will, why \\'PC game comes to PC game service\\' is exiting anyone here is beyond me. Shows how dead xbox is atm fir this to even be an article....I enjoy the game myself, but I couldn\\'t unreservedly recommend it, as its slow and a grind. But if it grabs you, its a unique experience, so its worth trying if you have pc gp... .This has been the perfect PR for PC games on Game Pass ...The mailman sim.@NEStalgia People were pretty excited for Death Stranding. Its PS4 release was absolutely a bigger deal than this PC GP port. Maybe not for you, personally, but in general for sure.Besides, I think most of the attention the game is getting right now is amusement over how Sony seems unable to keep games they were involved with developing off of Game Pass.@Ralizah oh I definitely agree on the reason for the attention right now. It was kind of tongue in cheek that it\\'s getting more hype than when it released originally.

       " \"Call Of Duty Is Going Full Nostalgia With Latest Series UpdateGuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpBlack Ops 2 leads the wayActivision has revealed all the juicy deets for Call of Duty: Warzone & Vanguard Season 5; the final effort before the series moves on to Modern Warfare 2 & Warzone 2. Things are getting pretty mental in the final season to be honest, as CoD goes into full nostalgia mode with crossovers.Leading the way is Season 5's cover star: classic villain Raul Menendez. The iconic figure, from 2012's Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, returns as the main operator for the new content drop. However, the nostalgia doesn't stop there.Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is also getting in on the act. The Modern Warfare villain, Khaled Al-Asad, will also feature in the new season, alongside Black Ops 3's Seraph and Gabriel Rorke, from Call of Duty: Ghosts. There's even a laser beam weapon in here from Advanced Warfare, because, why not?!It's all a bit of a mish-mash then, before the series gets a sort-of reboot with 'Call of Duty Next'. Still, it's kind of cool to see all the games and subseries' cross over, with Call of Duty beginning to mix and match its previously-defined eras. All of this classic content begins to rollout in Vanguard & Warzone next week, on August 24th.Will you be jumping into this new season to check out the classic content? Let us know!About Ben KerryBen is a fan of action, racing and straight-up shootin' in any video game he can get his hands on. When he's not gaming, Ben spends his time listening to way too much Guns N' Roses, watching football and probably eating somewhere.Comments (2)Out of all of the possible operators to make it to Vanguard, I'm slightly surprised that Pierson from WWII never made the cut. WWII's ending had him returning to war and Vanguard is meant to be the sequel since Howard's brother is an operator. Guess Josh is all-in on The Callisto Protocol.I wish the battle passes worked for more than the most recent game. I don't really play Warzone and I still prefer Black Ops 2020 over Vanguard by far, so I have been unlocking a bunch of BP rewards on it, but never use them... But that's my own issue.

       " 'Two More Games Added To September 2022\\'s Xbox Game Pass LineupGuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpAlong with news of a delayWe do love a bit of Xbox Game Pass news, especially when the games aren\\'t far away!The latest reveals are both for September 2022, and they come in the form of Beacon Pines and Slime Rancher 2, which will be heading to the service on day one on September 22nd.These join Disney Dreamlight Valley, Train Sim World 3, Grounded 1.0 and Moonscars as the confirmed additions for September so far.In not-so-great news, High on Life will no longer be launching in October, having been pushed back to December instead.But enough of the sad stuff - here are more details on Beacon Pines and Slime Rancher 2:Beacon Pines is a cute and creepy adventure game. Sneak out late, make new friends, uncover hidden truths, and collect words that will change the course of fate!Continue the adventures of Beatrix LeBeau as she journeys across the Slime Sea to Rainbow Island, a land brimming with ancient mysteries, and bursting with wiggly, new slimes to wrangle in this sequel to the smash-hit, Slime Rancher.Excited for either of these? Let us know down in the comments section below.About Fraser GilbertFraser has an unhealthy obsession for all things related to Telltale Games\\' The Walking Dead series, and has an intimate knowledge of sports games on Xbox. He also supports Walsall FC – that team in the West Midlands you\\'ve never heard of.Comments (19)After watching a certain isekai anime im now in the mood to raise some slimes, slime rancher looks fun but is there actually a story to it? Or is it just aimlessly going around collection and breeding slimes?I was told about slime rancher from a member from here ( sorry don\\'t remember thier name ) and i really really enjoyed it , really excited for the sequal day one play for meIt\\'s a shame High on Life has been delayed but at least it\\'s coming in DecemberThe High on Life news is good news for me because I was thinking it was a 2023 release anyway.High on Life will most likely be pushed to 2023 in a further delaydude high on life will get delayed again 2023..It\\'s the xbox curse.GuaranteeSeptember is going to be one hell of a month!! Can\\'t wait.Damn...in December...Callisto Protocol and in January Dead Space Remake.They should rethink that launch window.@UltimateOtaku91 Not sure about the sequel, but the first game doesn\\'t really have any story to it outside of the premise.That said, it\\'s one hell of a peaceful, chilled game. You go out, you collect slimes, unlock new areas via gathering currency from feeding said slimes, and rinse and repeat. There\\'s quite a bit more to it than that (gameplay wise), but that\\'s the general structure.Also... I don\\'t recall that you raise the slimes, so much as just catch them, feed them, and keep them safe. Still, it\\'s a solid game.@FakeSunkist nah totally different genre and not everyone cares about horror games. I\\'m fully antipicating High on Life but don\\'t care at all about Callisto, Dead Space etcI was so excited for High on Life — I still am, but these delays are getting annoying. Please stop announcing a release date for games until you know it’s guaranteed to be releasing then.@BlackMayge Been saying that for years now. All developers have do is follow the rule of 6 and they should be so golden.I can\\'t wait to play Slime Rancher 2. That game has been on my radar forever.Never played Slime Rancher, sounds like people like it but damn that trailer made it look boring as hell. Is there more to it than sucking up slimes and putting them in cages or is the trailer just bad?@FakeSunkist Unfortunately there won\\'t be a typical good window for the foreseeable. God of War, Calisto Protocol, Starfield, Forza 7, Redfall, Final Fantasy 16, Hogwarts legacy. Then you have quite a few potential hits like forspoken. Typical big hitters Cod, FIFA etc. There isn\\'t really a good slot anymore.@funkhouser the trailer probably isn’t doing the game justice.The original Slime Rancher was a game I had no interest in until I sat and watched my kids playing it and it was so much better than what I expected.It’s still a lot about sucking up slimes. But there is a lot to explore in the world, secrets to find and so forth. So it’s actually more of an exploration game with collecting more than it is a farming sim or anything.@funkhouser I enjoyed playing it. It\\'s a management game, you can sell their \"droppings\" in the market that flactuates over time and you can use your profit to upgrade your farms, house and equipment. I got addicted on the loop of playing it. I hope you can get to try playing it.The curse of 2022 delays strikes once again.A slight delay only I hope. Mike and Rich from Red Letter Media being in High on Life made me look forward to it.

       " \"A Plague Tale: Requiem 'Gameplay Overview' Lands Ahead Of Xbox Game Pass LaunchGuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpWow!Right, here's a proper good look at A Plague Tale: Requiem ahead of its Xbox Game Pass launch in just two months! This new 'Gameplay Overview' trailer goes into pretty much everything about the upcoming sequel, including Amicia's new moveset and the variety of locales you'll be visiting throughout your next journey.This one is looking very impressive, which isn't a huge surprise, given how good the first game was. A Plague Tale: Innocence was one of 2019's biggest surprises; a harrowing narrative adventure well worth anyone's time! (Unless you're petrified of rats, then, maybe not.)Here's a written overview of what to expect from A Plague Tale: Requiem when it hits Xbox Game Pass on October 18th:Embark on Hugo and Amicia’s next journey and venture south of 14th century France, before setting sail to a mysterious island out in the Mediterranean Sea. Brave a terrible fate and find a cure for Hugo’s illness thanks to Amicia’s new resources—including the use of alchemy to manipulate fire and the long-distance power of a crossbow, but also her cunning use of terrain and ability to wrestle out of an enemy’s grasp. Choose to strike from the shadow or to unleash hell, with the help of Hugo’s new powers: to perceive surrounding enemies’ movements while moving stealthily, and to manipulate hordes of rats to decimate entire squads of soldiers.Is this a day one play for you? Let us know down in the comments!About Ben KerryBen is a fan of action, racing and straight-up shootin' in any video game he can get his hands on. When he's not gaming, Ben spends his time listening to way too much Guns N' Roses, watching football and probably eating somewhere.Comments (14)Loved the first one, still need to beat it. Looking forward to this, especially as it's on gamepassI didn't venture into the first until a sequel was announced and kicked my self for waiting so long ,one of the few games I'll play again after getting all the achievements,bring on the sequalAbsolutely cannot wait. The first game is brilliant.Looks like a big improvement over the first from a gameplay perspective. I just finished the first one not too long ago. Reminded me of how it felt to play TLOU, but slightly better all around.This just looks stunning and I can’t wait to get into it. Must play the first game properly beforehand though, it’s been on my backlog for way too long!Looks fantastic, definitely a day one play for me!Great get for Game Pass. I'll definitely be playing this game there.Yes Yes Yes, so looking forward to this my most anticipated release of this year, reminds me of TLOU 1+2 as well just finished playing them both and the first Plague Tale easily betters them gameplay wise i would say story wise probably on par with each other, I have high hopes for thisAs long as it doesn't suddenly run out, I have plans to buy my series x the day before this comes out and download it overnight. I cant waitI will be ALL OVER this game and Gotham Knights this fall. ALL OVER.@Royalblues now imagine if instead of putting it in game pass Royal, they just blocked it from other services instead of growing the audience and the value of their own service. Wouldn't you prefer that?!Looking forward to this. I wasn’t particularly interested in the first one - I mean, plague, rats and misery doesn’t sound all that enticing, but when I finally played it I really enjoyed it.Can’t wait for this lovely game I’m still playing my way through the 1st game so should tie in sweet as a nut.As much as I want to play this...I gotta get through the first game, and that's behind all the other games I'm into right now!! lol Tap here to load 14 commentsLeave A CommentHold on there, you need to login to post a comment...Two More Games Added To September 2022's Xbox Game Pass LineupAlong with news of a delaySome Notable Titles Are Leaving Xbox Game Pass This Month (August 31)10 in totalNew Lord Of The Rings Game Announced By 2K Publisher Private DivisionExpected to launch 2023-24Xbox Game Pass Is Hurting Right Now, But Larger Forces Are At PlayAll we need, is just a little patienceFour Games Are Confirmed For Xbox Game Pass In September 2022 So FarUpdate: Make that five!Game ProfileTitle:A Plague Tale: RequiemSystem:Xbox Series X|SAlso Available For:PS5Publisher:Focus Home InteractiveDeveloper:Asobo StudioGenre:Action, AdventureRelease Date:Xbox Game Pass (Subscription)Xbox Series X|SWhere to buy:Pre Order on Amazon \\n 3News A Plague Tale: Requiem's Gruesome Rat Tech 'Impossible' On Last-Gen Consoles 12News A Plague Tale: Requiem Releases Day One With Xbox Game Pass This October 4News A Plague Tale: Requiem Gets New Gameplay Trailer Ahead Of 2022 Release 4News A Plague Tale Series Is Getting A TV AdaptationPopular Right NowAll Xbox Games With Mouse & Keyboard Support 2 days agoHow To Complete All Xbox Game Pass Quests In 2022 5 days agoXbox Adds More Perks For Game Pass Ultimate Members (Augu... 2 days agoTwo More Games Added To September 2022's Xbox Game Pass L... 2 days agoFour Games Are Confirmed For Xbox Game Pass In September ...

       " \"Ghostbusters Returns To Xbox With A New Multiplayer Game This OctoberGuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpFrom the Friday the 13th devUpdate (Thu 18th Aug, 2022): It's been confirmed that Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed will release on Xbox on October 18th, 2022, with digital and physical pre-orders going live this week featuring some extra bonuses (thanks, Gematsu).Here's what IllFonic CEO Charles Brungardt reportedly had to say in a press release:“The reaction from fans of Ghostbusters has blown us away. Putting a date on and opening up preorders for Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed feels like an out of body experience, and we cannot wait for everyone to feel the same sensation on Tuesday, October 18.”Original story (Tue 22nd Mar, 2022): The developer behind the Friday the 13th and Predator: Hunting Grounds games has announced a brand-new Ghostbusters title called Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, and it's hitting Xbox consoles in Holiday 2022.Like the aforementioned games, Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed takes the form of a 4v1 asymmetrical multiplayer title where four of you are the Ghostbusters, and one of you is the ghost. The game features character customisation tools, traditional and unique gear and weapons, voice acting from the likes of Ernie Hudson and Dan Aykroyd, cross-platform play, the ability to utilise AI-controlled companions to fill teams, and much more.The idea is that it's an all-ages game, rather than something more adult-focused like Friday the 13th.Look out for Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed on Xbox One, Series X and Series S later this year!As a Ghostbuster, join with other Ghostbusters to chase and trap ghosts in museums, prisons, hotels, and more, and capture the ghosts before they can fully haunt the areas.Or, as the Ghost, hide, sneak, surprise, scare, and of course, slime Ghostbusters and civilians until the everything has gone completely spooky. Use trickery, deception, and Ectoplasm to gain the upper hand and drive the Ghostbusters out.Liking the look of Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed so far? Tell us down in the comments below.About Fraser GilbertFraser has an unhealthy obsession for all things related to Telltale Games' The Walking Dead series, and has an intimate knowledge of sports games on Xbox. He also supports Walsall FC – that team in the West Midlands you've never heard of.Comments (14)Another waste of a license that could have an epic solo player game.Just watched the trailer on youtube and it did remind me of games like Predator: Hunting Grounds, Friday 13th etc vibes. I had hoped it was more a Single Player game with a great story. I wouldn't mind this as an 'online' mode as part of an online suite but doubt I'd use it often...this will be dreadful then, a truly awful devloper.better as mentioned giving this license to a company thats good and too single playerSuper, huge, major Ghostbusters fan. But I'm not even the least bit excited about this gameDeveloper's ratings on metacriticDead alliance (2017): 43Friday the 13th: (2017): 53Predator hunting grounds (2020): 56 (ps4)Star Citizen (2021) 33 <- only userreviews though (pc)Arcadegeddon (2021) 70 <- two reviews (ps5) userreviews 46 (7 ratings)This does not bode well for this game....I've played Dead by Daylight a bit which is this kind of game, and I can see how something like that could be good fun with Ghostbusters. Likely a lot less violent too I wish they would nail this, but history does not lend much hope.If it comes to gamepass I might try it. I liked the Friday the 13th game even though I prefer single player games. Not much hope for this one.Oh well single player story campaign would have been nice love me some original Ghostbusters, this is just not a game recipe I like though and we have seen a LOT of them lately, but many do enjoy this game template so it's good for themReminds me of that Luigi's Mansion game in Nintendo Land..I'm guessing Bill Murray couldn't be bothered?Zero interest in a multiplayer game. Ridiculous it’s Not single player.the only game i will buy in the same kind is evil dead.F13 had a fun loop, but man, that had more bugs than a bushtucker trial. Hopefully they've worked harder at ironing them out this time.

       " \"Dead Island 2 Xbox Listing Now Live With Potential February 2023 Release DateGuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpFinally!Could Dead Island 2 finally be getting its grand re-reveal sometime soon? Well, the game has cropped up once again via a bunch of Amazon storefront listings, including on Xbox Series X and Xbox One.The listing in question went live today, August 18th, although pre-orders are closed for now with the game deemed 'Out of Stock'. Still, there are some fresh screenshots included, and a potential release date to go on.We can no longer spot an attached launch date on the listing itself, although Wario64 says Dead Island 2 is set to release on February 3rd, 2023. We could be in for another busy Q1 next year!Dead Island 2 was first revealed way, way back in 2014, and the game has gone through multiple developers since that stage. UK team Dambuster Studios is now at the helm, for what appears to be the game's final development stretch.Are you looking forward to Dead Island 2? Or has it been too long at this point?

I like zombie games, albeit I've never played Dying Light.I enjoyed the first two games, but this is an entirely different team and has spent nearly a decade in development, so I have no idea what to expect.It will be interesting to see how it's changed from the original gameplays. It would also be cool to get a vidoc about what happened with this game during its dev hell.I don't hold out much hope for this. Its development has been handed off to different studios twice now (from Yager to Sumo Digital in 2015, then to Dambuster in 2019) and that's never a good omen.Who do you voodoo b**ch 😎 loved dead island have fond memories of raiding suitcases, showing zombies how machetes work and warming them up with a tasty molotovPlease be goodI'm so looking forward to this game, and have been since way back when they showed that quite stunning CGI trailer. I know it wasn't gameplay, and that the game has been in a kind of limbo since then, plus changed Development teams a number of times, but I'm really hoping that it'll be good. I also know that I will likely pre-order it, though I will probably do so just a few days before it is released so that I have a better idea as to its quality. Fingers crossed, though. Fingers crossed....I have been wanting this game for years. I loved the original and the expansion Riptide. I have played through both games multiple times. I just hope this game keeps the original formula that made the first two games so much. Do not try to turn this into Dying Light which sucks. Something changed with Dying Light other than adding parkour. It just was not as much fun. I love Dead Island and Dead Island Riptide. Did not care for Dying Light 1 or 2.All I gotta say is, I hope it doesn't feel outdated.

       " 'Roundup: Here\\'s What The Critics Think Of JRPG \\'Soul Hackers 2\\'GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpAtlus\\' new RPG under the microscopeSoul Hackers 2 received quite a bit of attention from the Pure Xbox community when it was announced for Xbox back in February. Six months on, and we\\'re now a week out from launch, with early reviews beginning to hit the web.So, here\\'s a roundup of some early reviews for Atlus\\' new JRPG, Soul Hackers 2.I wandered into Soul Hackers 2 expecting a general sense of quality from Atlus, and ended up getting sucked into its world. While dungeon design can feel samey at times, it’s not enough to distract from the flashiness of the game as a whole. As usual, Atlus really nails the details; it was fun to hang out with this crew and see where things went.Overall, Soul Hackers 2 is a great new entry to the SMT franchise, offering enough differences from its comrades that it doesn\\'t feel like the exact same game. With its wonderful cast of characters, Soul Hackers 2 delivers a story that shows plenty of heart as well as heartbreak, with a theme that resonates with today’s world. Despite the bland dungeons, the combat is more than satisfying enough to make up for it, and the music is just a bonus to an already stylish game. If there’s an itch to play an SMT game, Soul Hackers 2 is sure to scratch it.Soul Hackers 2 feels like a budget title whose developers did the best with what they had. It\\'s still a solid game with plenty to love that fans of the genre will certainly enjoy. A strong addition to the Shin Megami Tensei franchise with great combat and art direction only held back by uninspired dungeons and exploration.Soul Hackers 2 is a competent Atlus JRPG that will tick a lot of boxes for fans of the genre, but it falls well short of being that next breakout star from Japan. With awful dungeon design and little else to do outside of them, it falls upon the engaging combat system and interesting enough narrative to pick up the pieces. It\\'s by no means the next must-play JRPG, but there\\'s just enough to Soul Hackers 2 that warrants a playthrough.Soul Hackers 2 is, at its heart, a streamlined Atlus JRPG, serving as a great entry point for anyone new to the genre or the developer in general. The combat and dungeon delving are entertaining, if fairly familiar, and the charming cast of characters kept me interested all the way through its roughly 60-hour campaign. But a disappointing lack of creativity in its battle systems and a fairly shallow overarching story mean this newly resurrected series will need to do more if it wants to set itself apart amongst Atlus’ best.Taken as a whole, however, Soul Hackers 2 is a mostly satisfying experience. The character interactions and stylish art help it stand out from the pack, and the smooth-flowing, fast-paced combat makes even some of the more annoying dungeons (I don\\'t want to see another abandoned subway for a very long time) feel like less of a drag. Soul Hackers, as a series, has a lot of potential to further grow into its own unique experience the way Persona has. Soul Hackers 2, despite its flaws, is a very promising start.Throughout the 30 hours it took to hit credits, I kept trying to latch onto the elements that work. Soul Hackers 2’s saving grace lies in its main characters, each with a distinct personality that often clashes with the rest. Witnessing the group’s growth by putting their differences aside and opening themselves up to camaraderie was a joy. I loved their conversations about freelancing as Devil Summoners as much as the tough chats about the people they lost over a meal or a drink. But there’s not a seat on the table for the player to take it all in.It\\'s looking pretty good for Soul Hackers 2 then, even if it doesn\\'t appear to be blowing anyone\\'s socks off. The game is sitting at a respectable 77 on Metacritic, at the time of writing anyway!Will you be jumping into this Xbox JRPG at launch next week? Let us know in the comments.About Ben KerryBen is a fan of action, racing and straight-up shootin\\' in any video game he can get his hands on. When he\\'s not gaming, Ben spends his time listening to way too much Guns N\\' Roses, watching football and probably eating somewhere.Comments (15)It\\'s a shame about the dungeons bad designs but I\\'ve played all of atlus games and I won\\'t stop now. Hopefully the story and combat is good enough to keep me interested.I got through the dungeons of digimon cyber sleuth so I should be fine 😂interesting that almost every reviewer mentions that the dungeons aren\\'t great...Super exciting for this game. Can’t wait  I’ve heard the music is also really good.@UltimateOtaku91 it’s by the TMS team; I don’t remember the dungeons being interesting there either but the combat was the stand out.@mousieone I loved Tokyo mirage session, I agree the combat was great in that so that makes me more confident in getting this day one. Still need to finish SMT V as well.Hopefully though this game isn\\'t as long as Tokyo mirage sessions or persona.@mousieone on a separate topic, I\\'ve seen you online playing that new Ai game, is that any good? From the trailer it looks good but I\\'ve yet to play the first game so I don\\'t know if I need to play that before the new one?Only thing that\\'s stopped me from playing the first one so far is that\\'s its supposedly 40 hours long, and I don\\'t know if I can play a visual novel that\\'s that lengthy@UltimateOtaku91 first off @NEStalgia will love you because NES loves TMS as well. I like parts of it but Tsubasa can do anything with a pep talk gets on my nerves aka the story. I love most everything else about the game minus the tact on FE bits .. it’s not as long as Persona but TMS is 30 hours as so is this. Maybe you meant SMT V?I love both Ai games. So does @SplooshDmg Technically you don’t need to play the first one to play this one. It makes you answer some questions and if you get them wrong it takes the spoilers out of the game. That said I think you get more out of it playing both. I don’t think either was 40 hours. The first one is a little longer than the second because the second has that hidden extra part for the Nonary games. Think my play times was 30 for the first and 20 for the second. I’m not a completionist. :3 the Ai Somnium games are like my top ten best ever games. They are visual novels with puzzles and QTEs and lots of fourth wall breaks @mousieone \"They are visual novels with puzzles and QTEs and lots of fourth wall breaks\"Now I\\'m interested, I can handle visual novels thare have extra things to do than just read, like zanki zero and the danganronpa series, but not digimon Survive 😂 the fighting in that just bored me.I suppose its on gamepass so I can give it a try and if I like it il get it on playstation or play the first gameAlso about TMS, it took me around 50 hours to do everything with the side quests and getting all weapons, SMT around the same but not finished yet, but yeah nothing compared to persona 5 Royal which took me 120 😬 but I did platinum it@mousieone @UltimateOtaku91 TMS#FE fans UNITE! <3...There\\'s only like 5 of us so we have to stick together  I utterly love that game.I preordered SH2 2 days ago. I don\\'t buy full priced games these days, I wait for sales even if it takes a year, and this doubtfully will sell terribly and hit sales sooner than later, but I just can\\'t wait for this one for some reason, and the previews were good, and early reviews are exactly what I expected them to be, so I\\'m excited. At least PXB is (kinda) covering its existence here now LOL don\\'t get us started on AI Som...did you miss how between me, Sploosh and Mousie we hijacked every PXB and Push thread for about a month and a half talking about it?  The first one is fantastic and is on GP. I\\'m holding off buying the second because it\\'s sold terribly and I know it\\'ll be dirt cheap sooner than later. I played 1 on GP but bought it on Switch for like $8 digitally, of course it\\'s 3 years old. I\\'ll probably get the second on XB when it hits a sale so my saves are all on one platform though.You\\'re reminding me why I still have not played P5, and making me wonder if I REALLY want to start it come October..... that will consume my next calendar year. After already playing XC3, and SH2. Maybe a bit too much JRPG in one go.@NEStalgia I don\\'t think reviews for this game are bad at all, the fact it\\'s averaging a 7.5 is not bad at all for a jrpg, I\\'m still contemplating which version to get off the store, the premium edition is calling to me with all those extras but £75, a week before made in abyss, and splatoon 3 right round the corner and my partner wants fhe Disney Valley game 😩Wish they would include the extras with physical versionAbout Ai, I thought it was the second game that was on gamepass but I just Checked and it is the first one, so looks like I\\'m playing that one first.How you liking XC3? I\\'m currently on chapter 3 and 33 hours in, the maps are absolutely enormous, I think I\\'ve already explored more map than the entirety of Xc2. The game also feels a lot easier to level up, I\\'m currently level 36 yet the current story level is 27, only negative for me is the simplicity of the side quests compared to Xc2@UltimateOtaku91 AI: The Somnium Files / NirvanA Initiative and the first game are bona fide must play weeb games. They are utterly phenominal. NirvanA Initiative is probably my 2022 GOTY. If anything dethrones it, I will be shocked. NES, Mousie and I have basically hijacked several console war threads so far just talking about the first game. It\\'s a thing we do.@UltimateOtaku91 Yeah, the one consistent negative point across reviews is bland dungeons, which, admittedly, for a dungeon crawler, is a pretty big negative, but it\\'s generally where I expect any Devil Summoner subseries game to land in terms of scores, so I think it hits at the goal it was reaching for most likely.I went with the standard edition. I looked at the bonuses in the premium versions, and none of it spoke to me. They both have extra story, but from past Atlus games I\\'ve never found the extra story mission which is usually just a thinly padded extra-hard-bonus-boss, to be worth it, and yeah, this is an expensive, expensive 6 month period for a Japanese games fan..... something had to be left on the floor somewhere, and I can buy the DLC later if I miss it. XC3, Splat3, SH2, Star Ocean, AI Som2, Diofield (maybe, maybe not, from the demo I may end up passing that by), and I know I\\'m forgetting things. That\\'s quite the shopping cart.Disney Val - [INSERT COIN] Yeah, definitely play AI Som 1 while it\\'s on GP. Very much worth it! And we look forward to the next few weeks of PXB/Push threads being derailed by AI Som discussion as a result lol!I\\'m loving XC3 so far. I think I\\'m level 32 at this point, I\\'m not even sure what chapter I\\'m in, I keep going off on side quests that lead to other side quests that have level 40 monsters and I think the main quest requires level 26 or something where I am, so we\\'re probably in roughly the same place post-Lambda. It\\'s addictive, hours pass by in minutes. I\\'m just worried that the game is a little too easy to level up. I seem to be unlocking shedloads of levels and content so I worry I\\'m sailing through it faster than I wish. The side quests definitely feel a little simplified, and quick to complete, but OTOH XC2 had the problem that most of the side quests you pick up can\\'t be done until late in the game, and some quests depended on completing other quests, but it never told you they did, and you could miss too many quests by simply not being in the right place at the right time, so it\\'s an improvement in that regard. Poor Monolith just can\\'t figure out how to get sidequests right.@SplooshDmg Thread: Microsoft!! Xbox!! Game Pass! Jim Ryan!!Us: DAAATEEEEEE!!BTW you ever see the Famitsu interview with the devs? It\\'s hilarious (and spoiler filled.) When they\\'re talking about how the Lemniscate secretary came to be, I realized who Date\\'s personality was modeled after @NEStalgia Them - \"PS is evil!\"\\nAlso Them - No! Xbox is Evil!\"US - \"This game traumatized me, and I can\\'t stop playing it!\"Lol no. I\\'ll have to find that video. I love how many cameos of the first game that the second game is filled with. Guh, I can\\'t wait for you to play it.@SplooshDmg LOL! That\\'s really the best description I can think of for that game.I ALMOST bought it full price weeks ago, but knowledge that I\\'m just tossing money away for a game that\\'ll hit good sales soon stopped me. And there\\'s just soooo much to play on the way I\\'ll never get to anything.@NEStalgia Yeah, I was initially going to hold off, but I was pretty happy to just give them the $60. I absolutely loved the game, and they can have my money. I was really worried the twist would get spoiled for me by the time the price came down. Saving a few bucks just wasn\\'t worth the risk.Crappy dungeons are disappointing considering both SMT V and P5R featured great level design in their own ways. I\\'ll wait to pull the trigger on this. Especially since I expect the price of this to drop like a rock in a few months anyway.

       " 'Fallout TV Show Images Look Incredibly Faithful To Bethesda\\'s SeriesGuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpVault 32 here we comeA bunch of images from the upcoming Fallout TV series have cropped up online, and the set is looking pretty accurate to the games, we have to say. \\'Vault 32\\' has been built using practical props, and it\\'s looking very Fallout-y thus far!As far as we know, this is the first proper look at an iconic \\'Fallout Vault\\' for the show, as Amazon continues to develop the series. Filming began in early July, and at present, we don\\'t have a projected release date for it just yet.Video game TV show adaptations have become incredibly popular over the last few years. HBO is currently developing a The Last of Us series, not to mention the huge popularity of Netflix\\'s rendition of The Witcher. We\\'re hoping this Fallout TV effort lives up the the hype!Will you be tuning into the Fallout TV series? Let us know down below.About Ben KerryBen is a fan of action, racing and straight-up shootin\\' in any video game he can get his hands on. When he\\'s not gaming, Ben spends his time listening to way too much Guns N\\' Roses, watching football and probably eating somewhere.Comments (7)In terms of production value, I think the show is better in the hands of Amazon rather than Netflix. And it seems they have some people from Westworld involved here so I\\'m sure it will look great. Will be interesting to see how the story and casting works out.Talking about TV gaming shows, quoting some, and not even mention Halo TV Series by Paramount, that means something....🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣Crawl out through the fallout baby..you know what I meanLooking forward to this like what little we have seen so far@GASEOUS 😬😬😬What’s everybody’s take on the Halo tv series? I’ve watched all 9 episodes and I really enjoyed it. It was slow going by building up to the discovery of the Halo ring but I already can’t wait for season 2 when they’ll surely be landing on the Halo ring itself with all the Forerunner structures and lush lands, rivers, waterfalls etc.@MaccaMUFC definitely didn\\'t enjoy it, couldn\\'t pass episode 4, why you ask? Cause I didn\\'t feel like it was Halo, how they lead with some characters and concepts just didn\\'t feel it was \"A new take on the Halo universe\", it really looks more like a sci-fi tv series that wants to do its own thing but with some little Halo concepts throwing here and there, also the plot/premise was kinda mid actually.@MaccaMUFC the screenshots and scenes that some shared with me also didn\\'t incentivize me to move on with the series hahaha, but I do have to admit that the acting was good to me and the visuals are superb, this aspect was simply GREAT to me.

       " 'Soapbox: We Need More Light-Hearted Spin-Offs Like Immortals Fenyx RisingGuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpC\\'mon, lighten up!AAA games love to take themselves incredibly seriously. Sometimes it works out and matches the tone of a certain title or series, but at other times, it comes across as trying a little bit too hard. To be honest, I feel like we just need more self-aware stories in AAA gaming, generally.One such example is Ubisoft\\'s Immortals Fenyx Rising, which is about to hit Xbox Game Pass later this month. Born out of development on 2018\\'s Assassin\\'s Creed Odyssey, Immortals created its own lighter-in-tone spin on the company\\'s own open world formula, and it worked.Stylistically it was compared to Nintendo\\'s Zelda: Breath of the Wild, a comparison that doesn\\'t get thrown around every day. It then added a light-hearted sense of humour on top of that, and benefitted from such a direction. The fact that it was also a new IP helped proceedings as well; Immortals wasn\\'t caught in any long-standing series lore that could manifest as additional weight.In fact, Ubisoft has done this a few times before, remember Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon? Sure it was a pseudo expansion to Far Cry 3, but its 80\\'s action hero theme and ridiculously over-the-top nature suited Far Cry to the ground. It\\'s a series that\\'s always played with just pure messing about, and in essence, Blood Dragon is the most \\'Far Cry\\' game in the series.Usually, this sort of stuff gets saved for DLC packs and crossover events in AAA gaming. Call of Duty has had its fair share of horror crossovers in recent years (yes, Scream Deathmatch was a thing) and that\\'s all fine and dandy but feels like a bit of a missed opportunity. I mean, I\\'d play a first-person Scream slasher, with all of the movie\\'s signature humour in place, within the CoD engine, wouldn\\'t you?I suppose the crossover craze is likely to provide these less-serious offerings in the future; it\\'s a trend that certainly doesn\\'t seem to be slowing down. However, titles like Immortals Fenyx Rising and Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon show it can be done as a full release and still retain the same level of engagement. Halo but you play as a tiny screaming grunt trying to murder ridiculously-tall Spartans? Okay, why the hell not?!What game series would you like to see drop a tongue-in-cheek spin-off? Give us your ideas down below!About Ben KerryBen is a fan of action, racing and straight-up shootin\\' in any video game he can get his hands on. When he\\'s not gaming, Ben spends his time listening to way too much Guns N\\' Roses, watching football and probably eating somewhere.Comments (35)Yes we absolutely need more games like this! It’s a terrific adventure that’s wonderful to look at and explore, and has just enough silliness to keep it kinda light. Awesome game.I thoroughly enjoyed this game, and despite comparisons, some general silliness in-game, and the odd questionable design choice, it\\'s one of my fave open world games from Ubi.It must have passed me by this one but going to play it on gamepass.Loved this game - I loved AC Odyssey too which I found much more light hearted than Valhalla which takes itself way too seriously.The constant narrative bickering between Zeus and Prometheus is often pretty funny and sets the story well, while also being pretty educational as they discuss Greek myths and legends with their own opinions on them.Honestly one of the most fun games I\\'ve played, had me hooked from the start - I didn\\'t click with any of the DLCs but the main game is entertaining, bright and a great chill out (gliding out from the main base gives a great view as well as being relaxing)Play a scream slasher with its signature humour?... Talk about \\'one and done\\' games. Maybe I\\'d play it to unlock Courtney Cox\\'s scream 3 fringe skinI’ll be controversial and say I enjoyed Fenyx more than BOTW, I just found it fantastic. It looks gorgeous, the combat was on point and I loved the puzzles, even the story was fun. I thought I’d find it annoying but it was actually quite charming I found.We definitely need more spins offs like that, instead of remakes and the 15th game in a series.It was super fun! The first DLC I was into but the rest, meh, all good though. Waiting for the sequelGlad that other people liked it, but I found the humor to be incredibly not funny to the point that it made the game substantially worse.Great topic!In a wider sense, I would love to see more light-hearted art (movies, games, books, etc).In gaming, I see many, many games that are \"trying a little bit too hard\" (yes, TLoU, I am looking at you!).Immortals was a breath of fresh air, even if the humour isn\\'t everybody\\'s cup of tea. But the effort, especially coming from Ubi, was very much welcomed and it showed that the developer still doesn\\'t run out of ideas.I certainly would love to see a sequel and I hope all the troubles within Ubi do not affect the development of new IP\\'s.Top 3 game for me that year. Hope they make a second one.@Hutchieace It\\'s one sexy game and all the dlc too@J_Mo_Money they are 👌🏻@Fenbops I found botw totally boring and most of the time aimless wandering around doing boring dungeons@HarmanSmith At least in the movie business, almost half the blockbuster movie industry is Marvel now and it is consistently light-hearted.Totally agree. Gaming, since Western gaming took over the scene, has become one giant grimdark disaster porn experience where gamers seem to love nothing more than embracing despair at all times. Even the PS360 era\\'s \"serious\" games were more \\'action flick\" than \"arthouse depression-causing nightmare\" other than anything Final Fantasy. But the tone of modern gaming has become that if it doesn\\'t make you feel miserable by the time you\\'re done, it\\'s not a serious adult game. (I say this as I play Xenoblade that\\'s sole purpose is to shatter your ability to feel, mattering not at all what friendpon say.)Fenyx was my favorite game of Winter 2021, and one of my favorite games of the decade. It was just a fun, enjoyable, light, cometic thrill with beautiful scenery and fun gameplay.To be honest, I\\'m not always a fan of Nintendo-ish games. Not in the sense of similar to BOTW like some people call this one, but I mean way too happy and innocent.Having said that, I had this one on my list for a long time. Say what you want, but I love Ubisoft open-world games. And this one looks fun to me.\\nI\\'m super happy it\\'s coming to Game Pass.\\nBlood Dragon was fun from beginning to end.Breath of the Wild is the most overrated game in history and also the worst The Legend of Zelda 3D game.I played this on XSX shortly after getting the console (2020) but just like Assassin\\'s Creed: Valhalla, had that annoying save game sync issue and random crashes. Hope they\\'ve fixed it now. Ubi has a tendency to stop support real quick with their games.One of my favorite game of last year , played on the switch and will surely double dip on my series s when it comes to gamepass.The base game was pretty fun. The humor was great (but i get it, it\\'s not for everyone) and the gameplay was extremely fun. I didn\\'t like the DLC that much. I agree we need more of these kind of games. So i hope Ubisoft will keep more of these kind of games, i generally like their games.One of the reasons I\\'ve been loving a lot of indie games over the last few years is for this very reason. They actually seem to have a sense of humour. Devolver Digital published games especially.@Widey85 I loved Valhalla, but you\\'re right, it did take itself a little too seriously lol. I just wish they\\'d do feudal Japan for god\\'s sake. It would make one hell of a great fit and would feel completely different to what\\'s come before.Definitely a game I\\'d be interested in trying on Game Pass as it didn\\'t do \\'enough\\' for me to consider a Purchase at launch. In fact, its got to the point now where a game has to do a LOT more now to convince me to purchase at/near launch than ever before - not because of Game Pass, but because of price increases, state of games at launch and even the \\'artstyle\\' can look \\'cheap\\' too.Its a case of being bitten too many times - trusting the marketing, trusting what the devs tell you and trusting the Publisher to release games \\'WHEN\\' they are ready and NOT before. In some cases, you also have to trust that the \\'content\\' you expect and have already paid up front for, will end up matching expectations. Quite a few games now \\'promise\\' content over time and the \\'base\\' content is not worth the admission fee at launch.None of that really matters with Game Pass. Maybe this was \\'worth\\' the asking price but for whatever reason, it didn\\'t convince me it was. If/when it comes to Game Pass, I won\\'t be looking at it from the perspective of \\'I have invested \\'X\\' money into this, it better deliver that \\'value\\' or more to me in return\\'. I\\'ll be looking at it from the perspective of does it interest me enough to try this \\'now\\' and then let the game dictate how much of my time it occupies - the better, the more engrossed, the more immersed, the more I enjoy, the more \\'time\\' it will fill.If its \\'not great\\', or it doesn\\'t appeal to me, all I have lost is a bit of time - not time & Money!. This is also why its more important for Game Pass games to have extremely high player engagement - doesn\\'t matter if its not the \\'best\\' looking games - those made to hype you on Visual quality and get you to spend \\'Big\\' money for \\'mediocre\\' game-play. If GP games don\\'t engage their audience, or become pretty but shallow, people will stop Subscribing and go back to \\'buying\\' whatever other games interest them. Its perhaps more important to devs/publishers to ensure their games are \\'quality\\' when they do go into game-pass because if people try and move on quickly, then they won\\'t \\'maximise\\' their return, gamers won\\'t purchase or persuade others to try - easier to convince someone to try a \\'free\\' game than to try something they have to fork out £50 for...Anyway, as I said, I\\'ll probably try this and make up my own mind about whether its a game \\'worth\\' playing to the end or not but it was a game that didn\\'t do enough to convince me to buy - even at sale prices...Wholeheartedly agree! Bit of a tangent, but one of the reasons I have such fondness for Nintendo games, apart from what seems to be an ethos of encoding joy into their core gaming experiences, is they seem largely exempt from the data- and money-grabbing most contemporary games are designed around. It\\'s absolutely refreshing to play a title like Kirby which doesn\\'t make you read through 17 pages of privacy waivers, or ask you to create an account, or show you what\\'s new on the store before each play session. A game\\'s lightheartedness is compromised to varying degrees by the extent to which it does this. Immortals Fenyx Rising is a wonderful game, but it\\'s also an Ubisoft game, which means it comes freighted with a fair amount of this transactional, anti-game poppycock (pardon the language). In this era of access to classic games via Nintendo Switch Online, PS Plus and xbox back compat, it\\'s both shocking to see how much better games have gotten, and disheartening to see how much has been sacrificed by exposing games to the corrupting influence of monetization and data-gathering. I do miss the purity of that old feeling of dropping into a game knowing that every trace of the real world has been walled off by this hand-made interactive experience, a space where data-driven engagement metrics and capitalist, transactional progression models have not yet encroached, before every game company had its hands in our pockets while ours were busy with controllers.@BAMozzy My friend, you may be watchful with your money, but I love how generous you are with those single quotes, and I have come to partake in your \\'largesse\\'...I find your viewpoint interesting because it runs counter to my experience. I\\'m a long-time Game Pass subscriber and find it great value for money. But a survey of my gaming history shows that when credits roll on a title, more often than not I have purchased it, rather than accessed it through one of my subscriptions. Perhaps it\\'s just capitalism thoroughly baked into my psyche, but the game ownership dynamic seems to tether me more closely to a title and make it harder for me to move on from. Does that mean I\\'m having superior gaming experiences? Absolutely not. It could very well imply that I\\'m spending time on games I otherwise wouldn\\'t simply because I threw some currency at them.Anyway, I appreciate your perspective and thoroughly agree that substance over style will ultimately determine the success of any game and therefore any subscription service. The only game I\\'ve pre-ordered EVER is Horizon Forbidden West, and while I fully believed in the hype of that game because of the studio behind it and my experience playing the original, there was the added incentive of $10 off the launch price due to Sony\\'s botching the PS5 upgrade path. I do love sticking my head out the window of a fast-moving hype train, but healthier by far to ignore the promises of marketing departments and gauge reactions from critics and fellow gamers before opening your wallet.@Banjo- Breath of the Wild is probably my favorite game of all time? But, like any game, I can see why it\\'s not for everyone. I\\'m curious... what are your top 5? Just to give your comment some context.@HarmanSmith Ubisoft did seem to have abandoned one of gaming\\'s most absurd and entertaining creations: Rayman. How wonderful it was to see a title like Fenyx emerge from the murderous diamond mine that Ubisoft have become. They were capable of incredible humor and creativity in the past, so it was quite refreshing to see that flame not entirely snuffed out within their stable of studios.@nofriendo Everyone is an individual with their own unique views, opinions, values etc so things like Subscription vs Purchase will have a different impact to everyone. Some may find that they use Game Pass to \\'try before they buy\\', knowing what they are getting, that they are \\'enjoying\\' what was offered and willing to buy to support the Devs a bit more than Game Pass does and also know that you can \\'replay\\' anytime whether you are still subscribed and /or the game remains in that service or not. Also you may want to \\'buy\\' with the 20% discount when it leaves too as its much, much cheaper by then and you may of invested money in DLC etc too.There are games that I play through, get to the end and delete having enjoyed my time. But knowing its not something I\\'m going to play again, not going to buy - but I\\'ve still supported the dev as they got money from me playing (maybe more if I finished the game as I hear they also offer a player engagement \\'bonus\\' as one of the options for devs/publishers negotiating terms with MS) and its \\'more\\' money than they would have received had I not played the game at all - because I wasn\\'t going to buy it...I would never buy games like the Great Escape, the Medium, The Gunk etc so they would of got \\'nothing\\' from me - even in a sale. Now they got money because I played the game to completion on Game Pass. If this comes to Game Pass too, that\\'s some more money coming from me that they wouldn\\'t have received otherwise and it may lead to a purchase - maybe the game and/or DLC too.I am someone who much prefers to buy Physical - I love opening up a brand new case, looking at the artwork and putting it on my shelf along with all my other discs. I\\'m someone that would buy a Disc to \\'keep\\' playing over the Digital version too. But with the way gaming is going, it may well be better now to invest in Digital games - especially if BluRay drives become obsolete on new consoles.Still each to their own - we are all individuals with our own preferences, budgets, circumstances and of course lifestyles (which affects the amount of gaming hours people have too). All of that factors in and why something may impact another differently to yourself...@nofriendo That will take a long time to figure out but I will list my three favourite The Legend of Zelda games for now: Ocarina of Time, Majora\\'s Mask and Twilight Princess.@Banjo- Man, I almost agree with you.I don\\'t know if it\\'s the most overrated (maybe I wouldn\\'t go that far), but everytime I think of BOTW I get a strong sense of discomfort!I sure see the quality in it, but it just didn\\'t click with me. It felt so obtuse, so \"un-Zelda\" (even if I respect the effort to try some new ground for the series) that I left it unfinished halfway through.Of course, I respect everyone who loves BotW so much. But it isn\\'t for me.@nofriendo I sure miss Rayman.I can\\'t understand, for the life of me, how the Rabbids (and I have nothing against them, mind you) are still moderately thriving but Rayman got canned almost a decade ago!Anyway, I hope Immortals gave Ubisoft\\'s creativity a boost and we can see other titles in the same vein.@HarmanSmith Yep, Rayman Legends is brilliant! In regard to BoTW, I say the most overrated because of reviewers praising things that they wouldn\\'t praise so much if it wasn\\'t a Nintendo game and the delayed Wii U game for the Switch launch. I wrote a lot about it but basically there are many things that are almost broken or missing except the exploration which is fine if you don\\'t mind the emptiness and disappearing deer.Of course, I respect people that love it but because of so much praise, I feel the urge to say my opinion as well.@Banjo- Certainly can\\'t argue with that trio. Ocarina of Time... I\\'ll remember what it felt like to play that game for all my living days. I rate Breath of the Wild higher because it is the only other game that\\'s managed to recreate that feeling for me, only stretched out to 550 hours and counting. Is it a much different game? Absolutely. Does it feel like the reincarnation of the soul of Ocarina of Time, just in a different body? It does to this gamer.@nofriendo I agree with Banjo, OoT and Majora\\'s Mask are great!But I can\\'t say about Twilight Princess, because that\\'s the only one of the TLoZ 3D games I haven\\'t tried @nofriendo It\\'s a totally different game but if you enjoyed it, that\\'s what matters 😊.@HarmanSmith Nice! I hope you play Twilight Princess someday. The Wii U remaster is awesome.

       " 'Death Stranding Officially Joins Xbox Game Pass For PC Next WeekGuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign Up\"Special delivery\"It\\'s true! As hinted at earlier this week, it\\'s been confirmed that the 2019 Kojima Productions PC and PlayStation exclusive Death Stranding is officially coming to PC Game Pass on Tuesday, August 23rd.The publisher of this version is 505 Games, which had the following to say in a press release:\"The original version of Hideo Kojima’s critically-acclaimed and genre-defying epic lands on the Microsoft ecosystem for the first time, available to audiences who are subscribed to the PC version of Xbox Game Pass.\"\"DEATH STRANDING tells a groundbreaking story of perseverance through an emotional adventure that those in the Microsoft community can now experience for the first time.\"You\\'ll be able to get hands-on with Death Stranding on PC Game Pass from 5pm PT / 1am BST on August 23rd, and it\\'ll apparently be the \"original version\" - which suggests it won\\'t be the \"Director\\'s Cut\" edition released earlier this year.If you\\'ve never played Death Stranding before, it holds a very impressive 85 rating on Metacritic for PC, and is the most recent release from the Metal Gear Solid creator, Hideo Kojima, who also recently partnered with Xbox on a new game.\"From legendary game creator Hideo Kojima comes an all-new, genre-defying experience. Sam Bridges must brave a world utterly transformed by the Death Stranding. Carrying the disconnected remnants of our future in his hands, he embarks on a journey to reconnect the shattered world one step at a time.\"Excited for Death Standing on Xbox Game Pass for PC? Let us know in the comments below.About Fraser GilbertFraser has an unhealthy obsession for all things related to Telltale Games\\' The Walking Dead series, and has an intimate knowledge of sports games on Xbox. He also supports Walsall FC – that team in the West Midlands you\\'ve never heard of.Comments (80)Wow! will there be achievements in the game?Any chance of an Xbox console release?@Joabra01Swe yes, there are Xbox achievements it seems, which feels weird saying@Dezzy70 doubt it. It’s still a sony first party IP. If it happens sony will probably bring something like spider-man over first similar to MLB the show.@darkswabber My dream, one day all games on one console on day of release from whatever owned studios 😊Just imagine turning that console onOne minute playing Mario Odyssey the next GOWR the next Forza Motor sport, all on day of release. That has surly got to be gamers heaven.That\\'s cool. I\\'ll give it a shot. I have a decent PC which I haven\\'t put through the paces in a while.@Dezzy70 we\\'re still a decade and a bit from that eventuality.@Dezzy70 no chance of a console release as sony are the publisher for consoles, its coming to pc as 505 games are the publisher for that version and can decide where it goes on PC. Though sony probably had a deal to atleast keep it on steam only for 12 months to maximise profits.Its funny though as over xbox sites and on twitter everyone was bashing this game when it first released, calling it a walking simulator and boring etc yet now everyone is looking forward to it just so they can rub it in lolPersonally though I haven\\'t played it and don\\'t plan to as ironically it is just a walking simulatorDon\\'t get too excited about it. People either seem to love it or just not get it. I am the latter.@UltimateOtaku91 Absolutely I don’t like the game and never willNot one of Sonys best games.@Agnostic This. To me it was nothing but a snoozefest.@Royalblues Maybe one day it will happen. All three could share console sales profit etc. and the best games get the most purchased and money for that studio.I don\\'t get why this game can come to PC Game Pass which is Microsoft but not Xbox Game Pass which is also Microsoft? Why not Xbox Game Pass?@UltimateOtaku91 It\\'s not a walking simulator, it\\'s a bat ***** crazy \\'delivery\\' simulator! Very interesting when I put one console all games on all three websites. Pure Xbox, most positive response, probably because the Xbox eco system is the most advanced.Push square, silence or a little go at me.Nintendo Life, I need to hide and run before they kill me. They absolutely hate the thought of Nintendo games on anything else but a Nintendo designed and made console.Goes to show out of all three what fans are the most backward and fan boy ish. Real gamers would want one console all games day one on that console.@UltimateOtaku91 but you know how this works: A lot (not all, but a lot) of gamers bash Sony games as \"one & done\" & \"interactive movies\"...But as soon as the chance to play those exact games on their preferred device pops up...they all of a sudden become interested...PC not for me. Great news for others though.@Dezzy70 I think you\\'re wrong on the reason for the responses to your \"One console - all games\" comment...Here\\'s why:First of all, I think you\\'d agree that the people who post comments at these 3 sites are more hardcore & stay current on day to day gaming news...So of the hardcore commentors from all 3 sites, Xbox gamers seem to want games from the other consoles...more than PlayStation or Nintendo gamers want games from the other consoles.I saw Xbox GP in the title and my heart skipped a beat for a split sec, then read \\'For PC\\'. They rebranded to PC GP just say that!It is a walking simulator. It really is. You even have to balance your body with the trigger buttons not to fall, etc.Gameplay-wise, it\\'s really a strange experience.Story-wise, it\\'s very... complicated. Nebulous.But also ? Fascinating, man. Really, really fascinating.I\\'m a Kojima fanboy, so what do I know. But after having finished it, I was like... \"Ok... So now... what am I thinking of it ? I\\'m not even sure to know myself. Have I liked it ? Loved it ? Or on the contrary... hated it ? Man, it\\'s so strange...\"But you what ? Days later, MONTHS later... you still think about it. The all experience sticks with you. The landscapes, the story, the universe, those fu..ing deliveries... It all remains in your brain. Somehow, somewhere.And I think it\\'s the mark of the truly great pieces of art.My advice : keep an open mind and try it. And try to finish it, even if it\\'s to say, in the end, that you hated it.Man, what an experience.@Snake_V5 My understanding is that Sony is the publisher for console version, not for PC.Also, I\\'m not sure about it, but I think I\\'ve read somewhere that Sony itself is publishing its PC versions, now ? So if it\\'s the case, a Death Stranding sequel would never follow this path and come to Gamepass.Personally i have little interest in the game but it does feel odd having it on an Xbox service. It\\'s not Sony first party so it\\'s not overly outlandish but still odd. Hope folks enjoy the game.@Dezzy70 I like Nintendo stuff being on Nintendo hardware….actually, i kinda like having three consoles with their own exclusives. Tho it does seem like there’s not much reason to own both Xbox and Ps5. Still enjoy both tho.@SplooshDmg Haha, OK then it\\'s a Royal Mail simulator 😂@Dezzy70 It\\'s a nice dream to have, however I\\'m not sure how it could work. Without any other hardware competition whoever made this device would have a monopoly and be able to charge whatever they wanted for it, with no incentive to make it the best it could be. If you want a great product, you need competition. I guess maybe you could have a system whereby different manufacturers could each make their own version of a console which had to be compatible with the same games, in the same way that Series X games have to be compatible with Series S, but then you\\'re putting extra strain on the developers to setup and test custom profiles for each hardware configuration. And this also sounds quite like just having a PC.@Spaceman-Spiff They could share the console manufacturing wise and the profits. The competition is of course the games. If all three and all their studios are making for one console the game purchase competition will be massive. Only the best games will sell millions.Fortunately with Game Pass Ultimate, which combines all 3 Game Pass platforms (Console/PC/Cloud), will allow me to play this on my 3080ti Laptop should I wish. I could of bought it on PS4/5 or PC by now if I was that interested in it!!From a \\'Sony\\' perspective, the Game has served its purpose. Any Console gamer desperate to play would of bought the game and a Playstation by now. Its even had a \\'remaster\\' (of sorts) to encourage \\'fans\\' to upgrade - now its hardly selling and this certainly won\\'t negatively impact Sony.For PC gamers, they too have had ample time to \\'sell\\' games and probably sales have dried up to. By putting it on Game Pass, they are \\'inviting\\' all those PC gamers to play this game which in turn will bring in \\'more\\' money for the devs/publishers and of course start another PR campaign - which may raise interest again on Sony\\'s console - and get a few more sales there too...@Snake_V5 Because Sony is the console publisher for the game and 505 is the PC publisher for the game. Sony decides where the console release goes but not the PC release despite it being a first party IP and owning the engine in which it was built.@rockodoodle I think Nintendo IPs could be far better on stronger hardware. As much I really enjoyed and praise Mario odyssey and BOTW given the power Nintendo could make them even better. Better AI, more enemies on screen, imagine Hyrule with the series x power the environment and environment interaction etc would be outstanding.@uptownsoul I think that’s a fair observation. I have all 3, but to have one purchase one box all games day one is my gaming dream. My pure one box digital game fantasy.@Dezzy70 The reason all games on one console would be a bad idea is because there\\'s be no console competitor. We\\'ve seen time and again how platform holders push their limits to see what they\\'d get away with. Like upgrade fees or online access double price increases. it\\'s the outcry from gamers that force decisions to reverse but without competition why would they listen? Where else would console players go to get their games? There\\'s no threat for the platform holders so they\\'d take the p**s.This game was sitting in my backlog on ps4/ps5 for years. I would much rather play it on my PC. I might actually get around to playing it now.@UltimateOtaku91 Basically. You walk, you drive vehicles, there\\'s some weird ghostlike creatures, dead people explode, and you can even deliver the mail late! It\\'s just like the real thing!@GADG3Tx87 Ok what if the console was licensed to all three but of course had to be the same specification at heart, then a gamer could chose what branded one to buy. So like Nintendo might make the console same specification but no blu ray movie player capability but it’s cheaper. Xbox might make one with blu ray movie player capability and cost more. Sony might make an all digital one, the cheapest. Competition is now there from a console point of view. The games competition is obvious, the best games will sell more.Damn MS really loves to waste millions on this wannabe movie director, hope they cancel the Xbox-Kojima gameHow many said it was boring and a walking sim, but are now hyped because it’s on Xbox?It’s a great game and a unique experience. I hope everyone tries it, regardless of past comments.@Dezzy70 the other HUGE problem with \"All games on all consoles\" is what one of Bethesda\\'s head developers said:(paraphrase quote and I\\'ll find & cite the source in a bit) - \"Focusing on less platforms allows us to make a better game\"If you believe what he says, and I generally do, then \"All games on all consoles\" will make all games watered down[EDIT]...here\\'s the source from Todd Howard at Bethesda: https://www.pcgamer.com/todd-howard-says-focusing-on-fewer-platforms-will-mean-better-games/@Dezzy70 I agree, I have had to buy at least 2 platforms to play ALL the games I want. There is \\'nothing\\' stopping MS, Sony or Nintendo from \\'Publishing\\' games on the other platforms - except that would see their Hardware sales impacted. People would buy the Hardware that they \\'prefer\\' for whatever reason - whether its game performance metrics, features, controller preference, UI preference etc.I think with Streaming options, that could become more a reality - a \\'Console\\' that offers ALL games. If you \\'prefer\\' Xbox (for example), you can play Sony/Nintendo games by subscribing to their streaming service, but cannot \\'download\\' and/or play locally. Of course you can with Xbox games because they were designed and built for that hardware.For the \\'Platform\\' holder, they are offering Local native versions of those games that you can download and play, Also games are often rotated so the other Platforms only get the \\'streaming\\' list of games to play - not the full list. Maybe you can \\'buy\\' games to \\'keep\\' them accessible via streaming...It seems like there is going to be a platform with ALL the games in the \\'near\\' future - PC\\'s. PC\\'s already have every \\'new\\' Xbox game released on it day and date so don\\'t \\'need\\' to buy the console for \\'exclusives\\'. Sony are releasing more and more games on PC themselves - acquiring Nixxes to port them. I know its not yet day and date, but if you are willing to wait a bit, then you could also skip buying a Playstation. You might need to buy a Switch for Nintendo games or find some \\'emulated\\' versions...I\\'d much prefer to buy a Single platform to play ALL games. I\\'ve been in a position where I can buy multiple consoles, but spending £450+ for what amounts to an extra 2-3 games a year at most. I don\\'t play EVERY exclusive because they don\\'t ALL appeal - just like games in general. I have bought Spider-Man:MM Ultimate Edition, R&C and Horizon:FW since PS5 launched - I refuse to pay £10 to upgrade GoT or any of the \\'other\\' games I already have on PS4 - so that\\'s 3 games in 2 yrs that I couldn\\'t play on my Series X. I know they have had more games (Deathloop, Ghostwire - both likely to be on Game Pass so I\\'ll wait, GT7, Demon Souls, Returnal etc didn\\'t appeal) but on average, its about 2 to 3 games a year \\'Max\\' - the rest can be played on either. So for me, I\\'d love a one for all...As for the Fanboyism, I think that comes down to the \\'average\\' maturity levels of their user base. Nintendo do appeal to a \\'young\\' demographic - I know they appeal to a wide range of ages and obviously nostalgia plays a part too - but you are going to have quite a lot of young gamers. Sony seems more \\'teenage/young adult\\' - still locked in that Console mentality whilst Xbox is more Adult/mature - They don\\'t get annoyed about games releasing on PC, embrace things like cross-play etc.Of course all have a mix of ages so there are \\'mature\\' gamers on all 3 platforms, but the majority (or should that be \\'vocal\\' majority that frequent gaming sites) do tend to be different and that is evident by the fanboy balance and \\'maturity\\' of the people running these sites - I\\'m sure that they contribute a LOT to that too - if their articles were more \\'maturely\\' written and their comments/forums policed more maturely, then maybe it wouldn\\'t be quite so evident!!I loved Death stranding Im no kojima fan boy but its was a strangely relaxing medative experience getting from A to B delivering stuff exploring the world and finding out what happened and who you and other are and their stories.A very rewarding experience@uptownsoul This is partly why I think that Cloud/Streaming Platforms will become the \\'standard\\' in the future. You only need to build \\'one\\' version of the game, made to run in the cloud with \\'no\\' minimum spec hardware to set the \\'baseline\\'. No porting and optimizing for multiple platforms and their OS and API\\'s, no concerns over scaling up/down and/or targeting say visuals (higher visual settings) at the expense of Frame Rate (capped to 30fps) - you get the \\'same\\' version running the same way on EVERY device (as long as your internet connection is consistently high enough)Xbox Cloud games are running on \\'Virtual\\' Series X hardware built into servers. It doesn\\'t matter whether you have just a Smart TV, mobile or \\'cheap\\' student laptop (no discrete GPU and definitely not got the CPU or RAM performance to run it), even last gen Xbox consoles, PS4/PS5, Nintendo Switch - the last 2 if Sony/Nintendo allowed them) etc all play MSFS - a game that only released on PC and Series consoles.A \\'server\\' could be built to be much more powerful than any domestic PC/Console could be - certainly in terms of affordability for the masses. Devs could utilise that to make games impossible to port/run on any hardware and stream to EVERY compatible device therefore making hardware platforms basically unimportant. It\\'ll be like buying a TV and having every Game/TV/Movie/Music service apps available - you want to play Xbox games Subscribe to Game Pass, Sony games, subscribe to Playstation+ - indies and 3rd Party publishers who don\\'t have their own service could release across several services at once..Of course, if/when it gets to that point, every device is a \\'multi-platform\\' device. The platform stops being \\'external\\' hardware we as gamers can buy, and becomes the \\'app/service\\' we subscribe to.Sony fanboys gonna erupt over this@uptownsoul It’s one console only that plays all games. That would be a lot better.@uptownsoul Good point, perhaps that is why Nintendo and Sony normally get the best out of their hardware. They focus on just one bit of kit. Sony think about the PC conversation later down the line with usually a side studio undertaking that task.Xbox studios have to focus on series x and less powerful series s and also PC. Well done Todd glad someone at an Xbox studio said that, said that all along on here about Xbox studios have to focus on to much.Also I know what Todd meant by what he said, no PS5 or Switch.@BAMozzy Cloud/Streaming wont be the standard in our lifetime...Internet is too far behind@Dezzy70 One console makes sense...but business wise you got to ask, which 2 of the 3 console makers is gonna stop making consoles...If you\\'re an open-minded person who likes bonkers stories with slow-paced, albeit challenging and rewarding, gameplay that sets itself apart from most modern games in over-saturated genres then you\\'ll love Death Stranding.@Dezzy70 @GADG3Tx87 @Spaceman-Spiff There already is one box that has everything (except Nintendo). It\\'s called PC. The only problem is it\\'s super expensive and totally non-standard which shouldn\\'t be a big problem. Really it could work a lot like what Steambox was supposed to be had Valve not totally blown it. Essentially an open spec of certified machines, so arguably Apple, Samsung, Sony, Huawei, Microsoft, Nintendo, Dell, HP, LG, Razer, could all try to offer their own hardware that meet the console spec and go through certification. The certification could be a committee made up of software publishers (MS, Nintendo, Sony, Embracer, EA, etc.) And that could unify PC/console for development purposes.Technically we should already have had that but Valve dropped the ball super hard on the Steambox. Otherwise there\\'s the cloud future which is really going to be the main future anyway. Complete with subscriptions to every individual publisher like how TV works.........@uptownsoul I used to think cloud couldn\\'t ever be standard, but that was until they built the gigantic poorly thought out 5G cellular network that nobody actually has a use or need for. And then the telcos intend to halt wired internet rollout and move everything to 5g saturation. It\\'s a mess, BUT I do think over the decade/generation we\\'re going to see cloud become a lot more viable in a lot more areas and the majority of \"casual\" gamers (which is like 80% of gamers) will migrate to that much cheaper ecosystem that works \"well enough\". I think we\\'ll hit a point where we laugh at it, then accept is as an alternative for some, then one day wonder why it seems like all industry focus is on the streaming market and then realize that\\'s because that\\'s where most people play and the consoles are an increasingly expensive exotic niche nearing the end. It\\'s happening in real-time, but we\\'re in a bubble and not seeing it as immediately (even if we\\'re actively doing it ourselves.)@Krzzystuff It kinda is Sony 1st party. They own the IP, even though Kojma develops it. But they sold the PC publishing rights originally. Now they have their own in-house PC focus but back then, they didn\\'t.@Dezzy70 LOL! To be fair, Nintendo fan response might be a result of PTSD from that time the CDi got Nintendo games......  The argument has always been that Nintendo designing games for hardware other than their own will lead to a loss in quality, but inside the Switch is basically just an nVidia Shield with custom tuning. Their business model depends on the walled garden, but the hardware, starting with Switch, isn\\'t particularly unique anymore other than it\\'s form factor/controller setup.@SplooshDmg I thought that was called \"Prime\"?@Snake_V5 PC and XB Game Pass have different licensing, which is why they also have separate subscriptions (both are included in Ultimate.) There\\'s games on PC that don\\'t exist on console that are on PCGP, and some games on console that don\\'t go to PC, etc. In this case, Sony publishes the PS console version, but contracted out to 505 to publish the PC version. And Kojima Productions never made an Xbox version so there isn\\'t one that could appear on XBGP even if anyone wanted it to, and Sony owns the IP so Kojima never will make an Xbox version.@LtSarge Couldn\\'t agree more with you.@Dezzy70 here is what i think will mostly likely happen within the next 5 years: there will always be exclusives, but it will become less common. most 1st party games will be TIMED exclusives. games like Spider-Man and maybe Gears, games that we know would sell like crazy, will go to the \"other\" platform 1-2 years after they release on their home console, basically when sales of the title begin to slow down on the home console. this would prop up sales and even help keep prices down (you wouldn\\'t need to charge $70 if you know you can add 1-5 million more sales this way). fans would still stick with their preferred console because they\\'d get to play these games first, but ultimately, as game production budgets get bigger and bigger, full permanent exclusivity will make less and less sense. Hell, Companies would already be doing this if they weren\\'t so sure we\\'d whine and cry about it lol@NEStalgia The only Prime that matters is Metroid.@uptownsoul Not really. You don\\'t need \\'crazy\\' internet bandwidth to play games via streaming. Its already at a point where playing games via streaming adds \\'imperceptible\\' lag - maybe a few ms slower, but that\\'s not too bad.Internet standards are improving all the time. When PSNow had streaming on other devices, inc my Smart TV app, a lot were still on dial-up, up to 8Mb/s but now, most can stream 4k Netflix which has a higher bandwidth requirement than 1080/60 Game Pass. Now I know that 1080p with compression artefacts is not as good as Native Series X can offer, but it can still offer \\'better\\' than playing Native on last gen hardware.In the UK, there is a push for High Speed Internet coverage \\'everywhere\\' - inc Fibre Optic to the house - not just to the nearest junction box. 5G is becoming the standard in mobiles now and no doubt that will evolve. WiFi too is evolving. A lot of countries do seem to have plans to improve and increase their High Speed Internet coverage - raising the \\'minimum\\' acceptable speeds across the whole country. In the UK, they expect gigabit broadband to be available \\'nationwide\\' by 2030 and in the US, a new proposal by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, the minimum broadband speeds in America would be raised to 100 Mbits/sec down and 20 Mbits/sec up - that\\'s more than ample to stream any game at 4k...MS has its own \\'cloud\\' publishing department. These are for games built specifically to run in the cloud \\'only\\' - Kojimas project was rumoured to be cloud based because \\'local\\' hardware cannot do what he envisions.If people will buy a Switch to play \\'worse\\' versions of \\'great\\' games on the go, then the\\'ll likely to subscribe to streaming to play much better looking and running versions on their \\'mobile\\' devices. Some 540p upscaled to 720p and capped to 30fps with \\'low\\' visual settings to play \\'locally\\' on Switch or play at 1080/60 high visual settings via streaming for less money...If the new games like CoD, Fifa, Tomb Raider, GTA etc are only released on a streaming platform, then people will also subscribe. It has a LOT of benefits or the dev/publisher - like not having to worry about the \\'weakest\\' spec in their design, not having to port the game to various different platforms and get them working with their OS/API\\'s, no distribution or manufacturing costs reducing development costs without reducing quality. You are literally making just 1 game for a single platform and that one version being the same quality/standard for ALL customers - instantly available, no need to wait hours to download, install or update and of course no risk of Piracy, mods/cheaters etc either...@armondo36 Very good theory that could be an alternative.@NEStalgia The PC as you even said does not do Nintendo Also it does not do all games Playstation and not on day one. I mean one box true console style.@uptownsoul None they could all release a console with same heart specification and gamers choose their preferred brand and controller. But maybe different varieties. Nintendo, no blu ray 4K playerXbox, digital onlySony, With blu ray 4K playerSort of like that you get the idea.Still probably won’t play this. This game disturbed me from the first trailer.@SplooshDmg Doesn\\'t matter which Prime it is. You know it\\'s indefinitely delayed either way!Kojima game just do nothing for me.@BAMozzy being a viable alternative is not the same as being the standard... Every time the internet takes a step, so does our games...The gap between out internet speeds & how demanding our games will remain too big for streaming to be \"the standard\"@Dezzy70 maybe I am just old school, but part of Nintendo’s magic is their quirky way of doing things….it’s not the best example by any means, but it just feels awkward playing Nintendo stuff on other devices like Mario Kart Tour or the Mario runner.Granted, I agree with you in that the device is feeling dated and is due for at least a pro model soon. OTOH, I feel like the longer we wait, the better the specs will be for the next gen system….@uptownsoul I don\\'t disagree there are still gaps in internet capability that makes streaming have a varying degree of issues in a varying degree of locales for the moment. But what do you mean by \"the gap between speeds and how demanding games\" are? PS15 games will use exactly the same bandwidth as PS3 games use at the same output resolution and audio quality, which is close to what Netflix and Hulu use as well, or doubled for framerate difference (24fps film vs 60fps, 120fps games etc.) It\\'s just a video stream with byte-level inputs, and technologies are evolving specifically around streaming games to make it more and more feasible.Boring as it was, did you watch Verizon\\'s E3 presentation last year? It wasn\\'t bout console cloud streaming or whatnot so much as it was about mobile gaming, but the tech being described was still an interesting insight into what the future of gaming in a cloud future might look like. The TL;DR of it is they\\'re building out (mostly for mobile for now, and only for wireless, not wired for now) local processing capability at the cell tower level, so that things like inputs etc can be processed at the local tower level without having to go out on the backhaul. Or to simplify it a bit more \"cloud gaming, where part of the \"console\" is local on your tower and processing some of the netcode etc for play locally. Or bringing the \"cloud\" physically closer to your point of use, for the most critical, time-sensitive pieces.Again, that\\'s not widespread, it has nothing to do with console cloud gaming for the most part yet, etc, it\\'s a specific thing aimed at competitive play largely on mobile devices. But it\\'s a preview of the KIND of tech that\\'s going to be increasingly implemented across the telco networks that will facilitate improvements to what we think of as \"cloud\" play in the future. It absolutely will evolve in directions we tend not to think about based on traditional \"I\\'m in NY and the cloud server is in LA, and that\\'s how long the input takes.\"Cloud is here, it\\'s going to keep improving and growing and a LOT of money is being invested into the infrastructure to make it happen. There\\'s no question eventually we hit a point where most people, the casual market, which is most of the market, will find it good enough and cheap enough to play on \"rented\" hardware, and the industry will align with that shift. IDK if it\\'ll be next gen or 5 gens from now, but it\\'ll happen. And it\\'ll leave behind people in the wrong postal codes that don\\'t have the best access, and yes, that really sucks, and Nintendo will probably still make a device that works for them, lol.@NEStalgia what you\\'re pointing to is a viable alternative...which I agree can be close...But \"the standard\"...is still a long, long time from now.@rockodoodle the Switch pro controller is basically just an Xbox controller with gyros and a mirrored button mapping.... IDK if it feels any different to play on that than on an Xbox tbh.What I worry about with Nintendo, though, is they keep their hardware quirky, sideways, and therefore underpowered, and their games are tailored around lower budget dev costs where the limitations of the hardware hide the production value limitations in their games compared to the rest of the \"AAA\" industry. If they just go ahead and make a more powerful Switch, I don\\'t know how Nintendo\\'s going to really leverage increasingly generic non-unique hardware in a way that their games don\\'t start looking like they punch below the weight of the hardware they\\'re running on. Sure they need a Switch that can do 1080p/60 and not have background animations running in 3-frame animation loops (looking at you Kirby Forgotten Lands), but if they just make a \"much more powerful Switch 2\" I can\\'t see them really changing the production values of their games At all to match it other than just maintaining high res, stable fps, and not cutting the draw distance in half. And I\\'m not sure most of Nintendo\\'s market could possibly care less about those details.@uptownsoul \"Standard\" isn\\'t what core gamers want and feel is best. \"Standard\" is whatever the mass market of FIFA/GTA players find acceptable enough for the value price. I agree, right NOW it\\'s a viable alternative. But costs of consoles and games are going up and up, people\\'s discretionary incomes are going down and down, cloud gaming infrastructure is getting better and better and the market for it is getting more and more competitive with bigger and bigger players vying for attention. Eventually it\\'ll just end up that the bulk of the market finds what\\'s there good enough and cheap enough that it\\'s just the default. Eventually you hit a point where all the kids in all the high schools are just used to playing cloud games and that\\'s what they know and don\\'t really see a point in buying a $700+ console to do what they already do a little bit better (and the ones that do won\\'t often have parents that agree), and at that point \"standard\" has been changed. It may at that point not totally obsolete consoles just as Blu-Ray hasn\\'t been obsoleted by Amazon Video, but it\\'s not the standard of what \"most\" people play.Remember when MP3 became the music standard when it still sounded like aluminum? It was cheap and easy even though it was worse. Vinyl still exists for a niche, but it\\'s not the standard. Just how consumer tech goes.@NEStalgia only the core gamers even care enough about streaming/cloud to talk about it...As of now the mass market doesn\\'t care enough about cloud/streaming to see if it\\'s even viable for their home...So again, we\\'re a long, long way away from cloud/streaming being \"the standard\"@NEStalgia yeah, that very thought has crossed my mind. I am not sure what their niche will be post Switch or Switch 2.0 with games having bigger demands. If they don’t play their cards right, the next Gen Nintendo console has WiiU written all over it if it loses 3rd party support.@uptownsoul I think you\\'re underestimating the amount of casual players that are using Game Pass and Luna\\'s streaming products. Game Pass alone had a stat posted here quite a while ago about how 15 or 20% or so of GP users used only touch controls, meaning they played only on phones/tablets. I don\\'t know what Luna\\'s metrics are, but we can be pretty sure that nearly all customers are casual. PS Now was originally intended, largely for the Japan market, to get PS games playable without a PS. IDK what on Earth Sony\\'s streaming strategy is presently, but originally, it was that. The people that will be playing Game Pass built into smart TVs (and the delayed but coming streaming stick) are going to be pretty much all casual. And Tencent is working with Logitech for that streaming handheld (that will fail, but still...)I don\\'t disagree it\\'s not super mainstream yet, but I think you\\'re underestimating the positioning it\\'s at in the market and where that trajectory is building from, including current casual users. That casual market doesn\\'t talk about \"streaming/cloud\" they just know they can play \"that big game\" (AC Valhalla, or whatever) with a $50 controller. They\\'re not worried about the tech that\\'s delivering it or whether it\\'s much better or worse than buying a Series5XS. They just know they\\'re playing the game, it didn\\'t cost much, and it\\'s \"basically like Netflix.\"@rockodoodle One thing we know for sure is Nintendo will never be making games with production values like most of the games industry. It\\'s not what they do or the methodology they do it with. It would never work for them or their financial model. They sit somewhere between indie and AA pretty much always. They could get away with the generational Mario, Zelda, and Metroid Prime on general hardware, but, most of their other output......I adore Kirby Forgotten Lands, but at $60 on a PS5 it would crash and burn hard. And that says nothing of Metroid Dread and the like. Xenoblade is the best JRPG series around short of maybe LoH and Persona, but, I can\\'t see it\\'s current production values approaching more powerful hardware, and I can\\'t see Monolith going all FF with the production values, ever.That\\'s another reason I think \"Switch Pro!\" and \"Switch 2 coming next year\" is a miss. I think they\\'re genuinely worried they\\'re boxed into a corner and when they move on from Switch they\\'re going to be exposed to large cracks forming in their model, so they\\'re going to cling to it as hard as they can. Their games are beloved, among their own customers, but their entire model has revolved around having to make games for a closed system that\\'s 2 generations behind, so it all looks normal, and they haven\\'t had to really advance beyond the industry as it was in 2008. And I don\\'t think they really ever can. We see it crippling even other big publishers as they try to do that. How do they intentionally hold technology back to suit their development staying in the past, while also not just looking obsolete? I think they have to do a Switch 2, but I think they may have to make it have some crazy gimmick to justify it and/or have a short life \"WiiU\" Switch 2, as you said, and move onto a new gimmick after that.Nintendo needs to keep the tech in the past to match their production values and costs. The question is what will they \"add\" to make it exciting? More horsepower won\\'t cut it for their own games. They need the headroom, but stablizing res and fps can\\'t be the draw, their market won\\'t go for that. \"More powerful Switch 2\" seemed obvious...but....it needs to be \"special\"...in a \"nintendo-like-way\" to have its place.@NEStalgia good post. Not sure if this is really the direction Nintendo is headed, but there are rumors that there will be a Switch Lite with 5g connection….they are reportedly spending a ton of money on online play and infrastructure— vague wording in the shareholder financial reports, but it’s in the billions. Are they betting on streaming? Will the 5g Switch Lite be a test of this approach?This way they can keep their quirky hardware and hope that by the time the Switch is ready to sunset, they won’t have to keep up with the hardware ace nearly as much bc the gamer will have steaming options too.@NEStalgia \"15 or 20% or so of GP users used only touch controls\" ...link?But until you provide this link...lets assume your 15 or 20% is true:I don\\'t know how you can say that 15 to 20% using touch controls are casuals when the vast overwhelming % of people signed up to GP are the hardcore...As of now Only the hardcore know and care about GamePass@uptownsoul you are WRONG! there are about 3bn gamers who game \\'regularly\\' yet a \\'small\\' percentage of those play on Console - do the Maths!! 200m+ console gamers vs 3bn gamers.Crossfire has an average of 1bn players, PUBG 1.2bn, Minecraft around 740m players - that\\'s more gamers than Xbox, PS and Switch consoles currently in use right now. Candy Crush makes much more money than Call of Duty!Hardcore gamers aren\\'t really \\'console\\' gamers as the consoles are capped to 30/60fps. They maybe able to run the latest games but with \\'compromises\\' and hardcore gamers won\\'t accept a 30fps cap for 4k visuals. At most, they bridge the gap between the real hardcore gamers and casual gamers by being \\'budget\\' friendly (relatively speaking) for \\'dedicated\\' gamers without the means to invest in a hardcore PC.Its becoming increasingly difficult to build hardware to a budget suitable for the home console market and often lose money on each unit sold - opting to recuperate losses with services (PS+/Gold) and of course running their own \\'digital\\' store so get much more money on EVERY game sold.Game development isn\\'t getting cheaper, as well as distribution costs are constantly rising. Having to port down games to various platforms adds time and cost as well - much easier to make the game you want, not worry about the design and whether it would be suitable for \\'weak\\' hardware, whether its too \\'big\\' to fit on SSD\\'s or Discs etc.Its going to come to a point when Console manufacturers can\\'t make hardware \\'cheap\\' enough and still run the latest games at a significant difference to what they can do with Streaming and couldn\\'t distribute it on Disc anyway because Discs have \\'limited\\' storage. You\\'d never get MSFS on Console without streaming because the \\'size\\' of the world wouldn\\'t fit on Disc. All that is streaming in as you play. Its not much of a \\'leap\\' to have the game streaming, not just the world data. In fact, that\\'s how you can play on XB1, Mobiles etc...Console gamers are the most vocal \\'minority\\' and there will come a time when the \\'majority\\' are playing via streaming. Its much more sustainable, economical, environmentally better and of course much more accessible to ALL. Servers can be upgraded at anytime to keep up, no waste hardware at the end of their life, no need to make discs, sleeves, cases etc and ship them all over the world, increasing their carbon footprint, the hardware materials are not exactly getting cheaper as \\'demand\\' for electronics in \\'everything\\' is growing etc etc...@uptownsoul I don\\'t have a link for it, it was in an article here sometime in the past 12 months, but I can\\'t find it on a search just looking for \"Game Pass\" and \"touch controls\", I think it was part of an article on GP/Xbox metrics probably from one of the investor reports articles, but I\\'m not able to locate it quickly. You might be able to hit up Ben or Fraser if you really really need the source, they might remember what article it was in. I was shocked by the metric as well, I definitely didn\\'t expect it.But...similarly where does your claim that \"only the hardcore\" sign up for GP come from? It\\'s a major marketing point for the platform in casual sales, advertising, etc. The fact that some TVs now have GP support built-in suggests the target streaming market is very broad, not just the XSX buyers. \"Try GP for just $1\" promotions suggest they\\'re trying to reel in a very broad sea of people (Phil\\'s 1 billion gamers meme), and not just preaching to the hardcore. Expanding beyond the hardcore, limited console market is a major stated goal of GP.@rockodoodle I don\\'t think Nintendo is going in on streaming with Switch Lite, specifically. I think the 5G model if true is more about downloads and online play from anywhere, not just Wifi hotspots, eg, Monster Hunter, and Splatoon matches from anywhere (OMG I can already foresee the \"connection is unstable\" nightmare looming. Nuuuuuuu!)BUT, I absolutely wouldn\\'t doubt they\\'d be one of the first to go in on all streaming in the future. They\\'ve been playing with it with 3rd party games a lot, and I definitely never saw that coming. It works well in Japan better than anywhere, which is the primary market they\\'re concerned with, and their mobile-first success really makes mobile 5g streaming the core market for them more than any other platform. Of course they\\'re using the Stadia model which is too funny, and sad. Nintendo\\'s version of Game Pass would cost $150 a month run at 540i/20 and exclude \"select titles\" which invariably would mean Splatoon, Kart, Pokemon, and Animal Crossing, lol.I think if they did it, it would still be quirky and \"nintendo-like\", they couldn\\'t risk a generic implementation that more tech-capable companies can just replicate. I think they\\'d probably try to find a way to make the streaming part of the \"toy\" or gimmick rather than just a delivery mechanism.There\\'s always the rumors of a Nintendo Phone (which honestly would dominate in sales, but they\\'d need to partner with Apple, Huawei, OnePlus, Samsung, etc for production and I don\\'t see that happening.) It\\'s a hard position for them. They need a portable device that seems \"better\" or \"more unique\" than phones/tablets, that innovates on Switch, without making them change their dev costs/production values. Streaming would work wonders, but I don\\'t think the infrastructure is there for them to depend on streaming 100% yet. But I could see them pioneering there with a \"second pillar.\"I know Furukawa commented that they\\'re cautious about what succeeds Switch, for basically all these reasons, in more corporate-speak. I do think they\\'re kind of worried that following Switch presents big problems. I\\'m not positive they\\'ve even fully finalized what\\'s going to replace it yet (which goes against \"Switch 2, soon\" rumors.)@BAMozzy you wrote an entire book report for what everybody already knew...Sorry, but when I talked about streaming/cloud not being \"the standard\" for a long time...I\\'m referring to the super demanding games like a GTA6...We all know streaming/cloud can be the standard for Candy Crush, etc right now.@NEStalgia @uptownsoul article link https://www.purexbox.com/news/2021/12/xbox-cloud-gamings-touch-controls-are-more-popular-than-you-might-thinkWhy only PC? Not console at all?@NEStalgia my exact quote was \"the vast overwhelming % of people signed up to GP are the hardcore\"...My source is Xbox themselves when they say GP subscribers spend more than non-subs...If the ratio of hardcore to casuals were the same (in & out of GP)...the spending would be the same in or out of GP@mousieone thank you for the link...20% of Xcloud users are touch screen only...@NEStalgia my bad...I thought you said 20% of GamePass users in general were touch screen only@NEStalgia yeah, I didn’t mean that the Switch Lite was going to be a full streaming play if for no other reason as has been mentioned, the infrastructure just isn’t there yet. But it can be a test the waters of sorts to see if this is the direction they want to move in.@uptownsoul I mean the largest spending in gaming is candy crush, clash of clans, Fortnite, cod, fifa, and gtav. I\\'m not sure spend is a good outlook of casual vs core. Engagement time probably means more@NEStalgia that\\'s true, but it has nothing to do with streaming/cloud being \"the standard\" any time soon for the increasingly more & more demanding AAA games (GTA6, etc)I love seeing more games joining Xbox and it\\'s important that many of them are Japanese because Xbox One didn\\'t have many.If you have a little bit of patience, you can play most relevant games on Game Pass!I did enjoy this game at first but couldn\\'t get past the intolerable stupidity of the product placement of them big cans. I\\'d rather the option of paying a fiver to have all that stripped out, that\\'s got to be more than they\\'re making per user from the idiotic sponsorship.

This uniquely-colourful shooter was revealed at Xbox\\'s summer showcase, and it\\'s a console launch exclusive as well! Gamescom Opening Night Live host Geoff Keighley has now confirmed we\\'ll be getting another look at the game this month, woohoo!For now, that\\'s about all we\\'ve got to go on. The summer showcase trailer showed a number of short High on Life gameplay clips mashed together, so we\\'re hoping for a more extended demo this time around.We don\\'t have to wait too long to find out if our hopes come true, anyway. Keighley\\'s ONL Showcase goes ahead Tuesday, August 23rd at 11am PT, 2pm ET, and 7pm BST. Here\\'s that Xbox Showcase reveal trailer from back in June:Are you as excited as us about this one hitting Xbox Game Pass on day one? Let us know!About Ben KerryBen is a fan of action, racing and straight-up shootin\\' in any video game he can get his hands on. When he\\'s not gaming, Ben spends his time listening to way too much Guns N\\' Roses, watching football and probably eating somewhere.Comments (21)Can\\'t say I\\'m a fan of rick and morty but this game looks pretty good, like a cross between outer worlds and ratchet and clank.I\\'m looking forward to it actually.Fingers crossed this is as good as it looked when they announced itGot an odd world strangers wrath and sunset overdrive mashed together had a baby vibe. If it plays really well it could be very good.The trailer for this game was a pleasant surprise at the Xbox show, and really looking forward to it. Don\\'t think I\\'ll dive into any deep dives or anything personally, since I don\\'t have to be evaluating whether I\\'ll buy it or not, just downloading it and playing through it once I have a chance.You have my attention. Refreshing to see the creativity instead of the cookie-cutter, same-ol same-ol games that plague the Triple A space. Extremely refreshing ...One of the showcases I found to be really good. Looking forward to itI just hope I get a plumbus.I\\'ve never watched Rick and Morty so can\\'t compare but this game had me with knifey with his stab stabDid they ever say how long it is exclusive to xbox and when it would come to PS and or Switch?@Rmg0731 most likely 3-6 months like other indie games Microsoft get timedI\\'m too bad at FPSs to be interested in this one. Looks cool tho, but probably not for me.Speaking of GamePass, surprised you guys haven’t done a story yet on Immortals Fenyx Rising coming on 8/30.https://twitter.com/IdleSloth84/status/1559241703676166149?s=20&t=Jx50QwwyRCdUbcPlmmev0wLooks good definitely playing thisI\\'m still bummed I won\\'t be able to play this in VR like Trover.Heart skipped a beat there for a second as I thought it was another delay story. Really looking forward to this one.Been binge watching Solar opposites lately on Disney + …well worth the watchIt reminds me of Journey to the Savage Planet somewhat.This is at the top of my list. Online co op?@SpacemanJupiter hope so!Haha, I\\'m all for this!Hopefully we get a date, I don\\'t need to see anymore of it I was sold as soon as I saw the Xbox showcaseThis game just looks like crazy fun.

       " 'Hideo Kojima Teases Work-In-Progress Trailer For Upcoming ProjectGuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpCould it be his announced Xbox game?Back in June, Kojima Productions and Microsoft finally confirmed their partnership, with the two companies now working together on a brand-new Xbox game. It had been rumoured and reported on for months prior as well, following the release of Kojima\\'s PlayStation exclusive Death Stranding.We\\'ve seen nothing on the game so far mind; we didn\\'t even get a title when the thing was announced! However, are we about to see this Hideo Kojima Xbox title in action?The famous game maker has taken to Twitter to let us all know that he\\'s \"tentatively finished\" editing something, something that, knowing Kojima\\'s love of extravagant game trailers, could be just that - a new trailer of some sort.This update has also been shared suspiciously close to Gamescom 2022. The upcoming convention takes place August 24-28, with Xbox hosting its own livestream on August 25th. Microsoft hasn\\'t confirmed that any details on the Kojima project will be shared here, but could it be a showcase surprise? We\\'ll continue to hold out hope, for now.Are you looking forward to Kojima\\'s upcoming Xbox game? Let us know what you\\'d like to see!About Ben KerryBen is a fan of action, racing and straight-up shootin\\' in any video game he can get his hands on. When he\\'s not gaming, Ben spends his time listening to way too much Guns N\\' Roses, watching football and probably eating somewhere.Comments (19)I know Kojima means a \\'LOT\\' to some gamers, but I can\\'t think of any Kojima game that I enjoyed and/or really excited to play. I will keep my eye on whatever new information comes and decide whether its something I\\'m really looking forward to playing, something that might be worth trying as its \\'free\\' on Game Pass, or of no interest at all (like Death Stranding, MGS etc) - same with all \\'new\\' games...Still, it will be interesting to see and hear what Kojima is planning to do - especially if its a Cloud only based game that has been rumoured for quite a while. I\\'m interested to see and hear how the game utilises the cloud and what that will enable him to do...@BAMozzy same here for me I think he\\'s far too overrated ,some ppl like his games I don\\'t ,maybe this one will b more my taste we shall seeI\\'ll have to agree, but I hope it ends up being a great and monumental game and do for Xbox what Death Stranding did for the PS4.I\\'m an absolute Stan for Kojima. Wherever Kojima goes, I\\'ll be there to play it.Yeah I\\'m with the above users. Never really understood the acclaim. His stuff is different, which should always be appreciated, but for me, I don\\'t really see the buzz.@SplooshDmg Me too.I\\'m more upset that kojima couldnt be bothered with a mgs4 port, so now we\\'re stuck with never seeing it outside of the ps3 or streaming. Unless...Whatever it is it\\'ll probably have a bad storyThere\\'s always something special in his games even those with flaws. With death stranding it was the interesting courier mechanics, narrative and soundtracks that really appealed to me. If I understand correctly he is planning for this to be a streamed game? Would that allow for devices to play more computationally heavy games maybe? (Not an expert)He’s one of the most imaginative and creative devs producing AAA consoles games today. They’re rarely perfect 10/10…but I’d say they’ve all been memorable and stick with anyone that plays them.I’m really looking forward to seeing what he can do with the cloud. I’m hoping it will be a chapter based horror game that will use your location some how (local news or something) and really add to a sense of familiarity in a dark twisted environment. I’m sure whatever it is the trailer will be decent anyways.I really want to hear more from team ninjas horror too…that’s been way too quiet.@CynicalGamer Not necessarily streamed, but it will utilize cloud tech. Example, a game like Sea of Thieves uses Microsoft cloud servers to calculate complicated shared wave physics, or Flight Simulator that is millions of GBs of data stored on a server and streamed to a console or PC progressively while in flight. Essentially, the cloud can offer extra resources to local hardware that otherwise just aren\\'t there, which does enable designers to do things that were not possible before.I thought it was apparent this cloud game is still very early on in development@SplooshDmg sounds interesting. ThanksI’ve never been the biggest Kojima fan, I like his games, but I never understood the obsession over him. With that said, after a long time of making fun of Death Stranding, I decided to give it a try and I loved it, it was truly a unique game. I’m more interested in his work now than I have been in the past, though I’m still not clamoring for his next game.@Odium I still vividly remember MGS4 as one of the best games I have ever played. It is true that DS was not exactly everyone\\'s cup of tea. But he is probably one of the last video game authors/directors with full creative control and vision on how to make his games (as absurd as they may be). In an age of designed-by-board-of-directors products across all forms of entertainment, he is something to be cherished.One of the last true visionaries left in this buisness, he still has the influence to design and build a game without pandering to the marketting teams of big corps.Whilst his appeal is certainly not universal, and his designs are sometimes willfully obscure, Konima\\'s projects should be celebrated as an anthesis of the \\'cookie cutter\\' \\'design by committe\\' titles so often green lighted by boardrooms chasi g profits over creativity.Based on previous experiences, I expect theres only a 30% chance of me loving a new Kojima game. But theres a 100% chance I will find it interesting and worthy of thought, and I think our industry would be far healthier if we had several such designers able to pursue pure concepts.@BAMozzy that\\'s a \"you\" problemIf you turned Keanu Reeves Japanese you\\'d get Hideo Kojima.@BrilliantBill if there’s one thing I’ve always given him credit for and admired him for it was his ability to innovate. I’m 37 and have been gaming most of my life, to this day, I still can’t think of a boss battle that blew my mind more than Psychomantis. I struggle to think of a moment outside of X-Men on SEGA Genesis that had a moment where you had to rush to hit and hold the reset button or you got game over, that had such a unique in game mechanic. I’ve just usually struggled with his stories and his balancing of weird and real world. It’s his style, so I respect that, I’m certainly not one to tell Kojima to do something different, I just don’t always feel that the weird characters and story moments he throws into his games always work, at least not for me.

       " \"Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Gets New Release DateGuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpAnd it's not a delay!Activision has announced that the story campaign for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 will now release a week earlier than initially scheduled, with a new date of October 21st. The company is introducing an early access period specifically for the game's campaign mode, however, there's a slight catch.First off, this is exclusive to pre-orders, which makes sense given the nature of the bonus. However, it's also exclusive to digital pre-orders, meaning folks who opt for the physical version have no early access option for campaign.Thankfully, there's no platform bias here as is the case with the upcoming multiplayer beta. While the online beta has an exclusive period just for PlayStation users, campaign early access is the same across all platforms: one week early for digital pre-orders.To be honest, we're okay with this in general! While we'd like the deal to reach physical versions as well, it is purely the story campaign, so there's no pre-release multiplayer advantage to be gained through early access. The full game is set to launch on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S on October 28th.Does this sweeten the deal enough for a pre-order? Let us know in the comments!About Ben KerryBen is a fan of action, racing and straight-up shootin' in any video game he can get his hands on. When he's not gaming, Ben spends his time listening to way too much Guns N' Roses, watching football and probably eating somewhere.Comments (6)Oof, a significant blow for physical media!Well at least someone on here can give us an honest opinion of the campaign before full release ☀️@Olliemar28 Yep, pain.I always only ever play the campaign element of Call of Duty, and as much as I want to play this game, this is the first time that I might not actually pre-order the game, which is typical considering that they are actually giving early access to the only component that holds any interest for me.The reason that I'm not going to buy it this time round (or at least probably not, as I am pretty weak-willed when it comes down to it) is that I think this game will be one of the earliest entries on to the Game Pass once the acquisition goes through as adding this title will really make a splash.Having said all that, knowing me, I will struggle to contain myself, and I'll end up buying it either in a sale, or worse still, pre-ordering it.So weak-willed... @Fiendish-Beaver I don't think they'll be able to add any of the recent cod's to gamepass until after Sony's marketing deal is finished they could always put mw2 remastered on gamepass & update it to add the multiplayer thoughHmmm, you maybe right, @Would_you_kindly, however, the only thing that may count against that is that Sony were completely blindsided by the AB acquisition, and so it is probably unlikely that they have blocked its inclusion on to Game Pass as they just didn't think it likely to happen. I mean, why pay to block something appearing on Game Pass that you never expect to arrive there anyway?Having said that, you have now sowed a seed of doubt in my mind, and I can feel my will weakening still further....

       " 'Crash Bandicoot Developer Appears To Be Working On New GameGuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpCrash, bash.It\\'s been a couple of years now since developer Toys For Bob launched the well-received Crash Bandicoot 4, following a sizeable gap since the series\\' prior original effort. Well, it seems the Activision-owned studio is now cooking something else up.The developer recently took to Twitter to show off its \\'Wall of Games\\', a huge plaque commemorating all the stuff Toys For Bob has worked on over the years. Curiously, the team has a conveniently-placed slot for an upcoming title.Now, this could be anything, but the fact that the developer is teasing any sort of upcoming game has taken us by surprise. Last year, the team confirmed its involvement in Call of Duty development, specifically the free-to-play Warzone. Given Activision\\'s continued support for CoD, many of us assumed the developer was no longer working on any other IP.Well, it seems the team is working on something else! Let\\'s hope their upcoming game is either Spyro, Crash, or something completely new.What would you like to see Toys For Bob work on? Let us know in the comments!About Ben KerryBen is a fan of action, racing and straight-up shootin\\' in any video game he can get his hands on. When he\\'s not gaming, Ben spends his time listening to way too much Guns N\\' Roses, watching football and probably eating somewhere.Comments (16)Half-Life 3 confirmedBanjo-Kazooie project with Rare and Playtonic 😁.Many would argue against it, but I wouldn\\'t scoff at a Crash/Spyro crossover, possibly using the Skylanders lore as a bridge to connect the two stories together.The reported difficulty spikes in CB4 put me right off. Let\\'s hope it\\'s not another Souls like platformer :/I hope it\\'s Spyro. Crash 4 is amazing, and they\\'ve done great work on the Spyro remasters, they deserve to take the franchise over.@ymo1965 try it for yourself. It\\'s tough, but nowhere near Soulslike. There\\'s a casual mode that I wish all difficult games used that helps you if you die too much without actually making the gameplay any easier. It\\'s a great game.I hope its not a Crash or Jak game.102 Dalmatians rules. That mini golf mini game. 🙏@OliverOwen Jak is a sony IPClearly it’s a new Madagascar title.Memes aside, I’d just hope it’s Crash, Spyro, or Tony Hawk. I loved all the recent titles from those franchises and want to keep seeing them release.@DeathByLasagna Vicarious Visions should go back to Tony Hawk games.Star Control 2+I hope it’s something Spyro related. I’m fine if it’s another Crash Bandicoot title, but I would be even more excited if it was a new Spyro game. Toys for Bob did an outstanding job remastering the original 3 Spyro games, and I would love to see them take on a potential Spyro 4 that takes place after Year of the Dragon. Another Crash game would still be exciting, though.Love crash & spyro would love a new spyro game that\\'s more like the og trilogy also would like a remake of crash tag team racing & twinsanityHopefully post Kotick they can make games again. Crash 4 didn\\'t sell well, but it seems partially due to the terrible PC DRM. I think they could do better next time, it\\'d be a shame for them to be reduced to nothing but CoD support.\"New Crash? I wonder where you got that information from? I wasn\\'t supposed to leak that.\"\"I think we could see a new Crash Bandicoot, and not only is it gonna be a new Crash Bandicoot, it\\'s gonna be a multiplayer Crash Bandicoot... It\\'s like a four-player brawler almost, but Crash oriented.\"Jez Corden Tap here to load 16 commentsLeave A CommentHold on there, you need to login to post a comment...Some Notable Titles Are Leaving Xbox Game Pass This Month (August 31)10 in totalTwo More Games Added To September 2022\\'s Xbox Game Pass LineupAlong with news of a delayNew Lord Of The Rings Game Announced By 2K Publisher Private DivisionExpected to launch 2023-24Xbox Game Pass Is Hurting Right Now, But Larger Forces Are At PlayAll we need, is just a little patienceFour Games Are Confirmed For Xbox Game Pass In September 2022 So FarUpdate: Make that five!Game ProfileTitle:Crash Bandicoot 4: It\\'s About TimeSystem:Xbox Series X|SAlso Available For:PS5, Switch, PS4Publisher:ActivisionDeveloper:Toys for BobGenre:PlatformerRelease Date:Xbox OneReviews:Review: Crash Bandicoot 4: It\\'s About Time - Platforming Bliss On Xbox Series XWhere to buy:Buy on Amazon \\n 12News Influencers Are Being Sent Mysterious Crash Bandicoot Gifts For The Series\\' 25th AnniversaryPopular Right NowAll Xbox Games With Mouse & Keyboard Support 2 days agoHow To Complete All Xbox Game Pass Quests In 2022 5 days agoXbox Adds More Perks For Game Pass Ultimate Members (Augu... 2 days agoTwo More Games Added To September 2022\\'s Xbox Game Pass L... 2 days agoFour Games Are Confirmed For Xbox Game Pass In September ...

       " 'Wild West Shooter \\'Evil West\\' Has Been Delayed Until November 2022GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpAt least it\\'s still this year!Focus Entertainment has taken to Twitter to announce that its upcoming Wild West shooter, Evil West, has been delayed. At this stage, such a move doesn\\'t come as much of a surprise (seriously, everything is being delayed), however, thankfully it\\'s still set to launch this year.Evil West\\'s release date has shifted a few months, from September 20th to November 22nd. This will allow developer Flying Wild Hog to \"deliver the best experience\" for players at launch.The last time we saw the game in action, we were pretty damn impressed. Evil West looks like an incredibly fun and frantic FPS, marrying its classic Wild West theme with some over-the-top monsters and weaponry. It looks a hell of a good time.Will you be picking Evil West up later this year?

The folks there could do with a rest.This one looks really good.2 month delay isn\\'t so bad. A lot of games will rest easy in November with Hogwarts Legacy out the way.

Nice. I played the demo and it's pretty excellent.Definitely excited for Immortal Fenyx Rising.Three great looking Day One games: Immorality, Tinykin and Midnight Flight Express. And good mix of other games. Make sure you check out Opus.Tinykin and Immortals Fenyx Rising are great additions!Coffee Talk was a surprise, so I gave it a go this morning and picked up all the three achievements for the weekly streak in five minutes! Another game that appears to have been review bombed by idiots.That's a good-looking line-up of games....Immortals fenix rising is rubbish. One of the worst open world games Ive played. Looking forward to Commandos 3 and Midnight express though!@Clankylad Coffee Talk is fantastic. It’s the perfect visual novel for people that don’t quite like visual novels. Really relaxing game.Might give tinykin a try, the rest don't interest me thoughMidnight Fight Express and Immortality have my interest. TMNT Cowabunga Collection will have my time the end of the month, however.Immortals Fenyx Rising is probably my game of this generation thus far (and that includes Elden Ring). Absolutely loved the game. Cannot recommend it enough...The Xbox post hints at more surprise games coming this week, any idea what those might be?Kinda a great batch, IMO. Lots of variety and, in the case of Fenyx Rising, a game I had wanted to play but got washed away by other releases.Fenyx Rising is really fun. Great atmosphere, fun combat, some decent puzzles. Well worth a play.My one criticism is that there are TOO many puzzles in the game. Everything you want to do or collect is gated behind a puzzle, which is fine. But by the end of the game the player is really sick of pushing boulders onto switches over and over.But that is a minor gripe. It is well worth your time, especially if you have gamepass.Immortals ftwDefinitely playing Midnight Fight Express and Immortals Fenyx Rising@funkhouser QuakeCon is this week so maybe thatImmortals fenyx rising feels and plays like a zelda botw-lite, which isnt a bad thing. The humor is subjective. I enjoyed it. Looking forward to midnight fight express. Getting some oldschool beat'em up vibes from it.@Solidchief Oh man. I could really go for Quake II Remastered.@Solidchief That's true! Can't wait to find out what they have in store!@SplooshDmg Same, it's the 25 anniversary of Quake II so there's a chance we could get a remastered version.Glad I didn’t get Immortals Fenyx Rising, now I can continue ignoring on game pass.definetly a good batch of game i am excited about since a long time they finaly heard us 😊👌👍❤️dang it, i own immortals fenyx rising too. ah well, at least i don't have to worry about it being taken off gamepass this wayCoffee Talk used to be on GP and left didn't it? Could have sworn I played it a bit before....@funkhouser Hopefully Goldeneye!Thats a pretty sweet collection of games.

In a world where the use of powerful alchemy was once widespread and welcomed, things have gone terribly wrong. The now blood-soaked streets are filled with plague-ridden monstrosities and it's up to you, Corvus, to take out the mutated trash.OverBorder Studios' Thymesia is the latest in a long line of Soulslike experiences that attempts to capture FromSoftware's magic whilst adding a few of its own twists and gameplay wrinkles for good measure. As is de rigueur with the genre, we've got the same basic ground rules as usual at work here. Bonfires, now known as beacons, dot the landscape and provide a chance to rest and increase your stats whilst also regenerating all nearby enemies. Death sees you leave behind your collected memories, giving you one chance to return to collect them, and there's a central nexus, here known as Pilgrimage Hill, that you can return to when you want to wallow in the game's brooding atmosphere or have a disappointingly short chat with the one NPC who resides there.Yes, if you've played any Soulslike over the past few years, you already know the general gist of how things play out in Thymesia, but this is a game that has managed to garner some extra attention in the run-up to its release because, well, it looks the business. There's a nice art-style at work here, Corvus is a fast and flashy protagonist, and at first glance the haunted forests and bloodstained streets that you claw and slash your way through give off a little bit of a Bloodborne vibe which, let's face it, is a vibe well worth giving off.Further to this, the game's combat has got enough fresh ideas to warrant investigation. Corvus attacks foes with a combination of fast saber slashes and a slower, heavier claw attack. The general idea is that enemy health bars have got two elements that you need to work on destroying. Slash at them with your saber and you'll see the white bar turn green, indicating that you're inflicting wound damage. The white will regenerate and reclaim all of the exposed green area unless you then strike out with your claw, permanently removing the green portion and doing actual lasting damage on top of temporary wounds. Whittle the bar down to zero and your enemy will be opened up for a finishing move that's indicated by a glowing red spot robbed right out of Sekiro.It's a system that encourages you to keep on the front foot, getting stuck into enemies with combos - there is no stamina to worry about here - in order to stop their wounds regenerating. On top of this, Thymesia introduces a neat plague weapons mechanic that sees you steal whatever weapon skill your current enemy is in possession of by charging up your claw attack and then unleashing it, sending Corvus driving forward to pluck the essence of their weapon from them for a one time use.The plague weapons on offer give you plenty of options to play with, there's a total of 21 to collect, and they cover great big hammers, whips, swords, axes, scythes and more exotic blood-leeching fare, that afford you the opportunity to strategize somewhat as you blast through levels, collecting up memory shards to beef up your stats and skills with an eye on the boss that lurks at the end of every area. After a time you'll also unlock plague weapons permanently in your inventory, giving you the opportunity to set them to a second slot and affording Corvus a mix of permanent and one-time use plague weapons to play with. As you claw at foes you'll receive random drops of weapon-specific upgrade points which can then be used to strengthen the attack stats of your collection. Use your claw to attack a hammer-wielding foe and they'll drop hammer upgrades, sword foes drop sword upgrades and so on.With regards to upgrading Corvus' core stats, you only need worry about pumping your memory shards into strength, vitality and plague attributes and each level that you gain rewards you with a talent point to use in the game's talent skill tree. It's here that you can freely unlock and then reset various skills at your convenience in order to build a Corvus that suits your playstyle best. You may want to pump all your points into your saber, for example, ensuring it gives you lots of energy back as you attack - energy is what you'll need to pull off plague weapon attacks after all - and there's also upgrades for your claw, dodge, deflection skills, feather darts, and more general stuff like buffs to your attacks when your health falls under a certain level.The core combat system here really is pretty solid and unique stuff, at least on paper. However, you may have noticed us mention feather darts, dodges and deflections in that last paragraph, and this is where things begin to fall apart somewhat. Thymesia has got far too many systems in play for its own good, some of which feel utterly pointless and most of which feel like they need some refinement and adjustment with regards to how annoyingly tight their windows of opportunity are.Take the game's feather darts as an example, these are used to stagger an enemy's charged attacks and delay wound regeneration, and are deployed with a quick press of the left trigger. After being introduced to this mechanic in the tutorial we completely forgot about it, it just feels unnecessary, does very little damage - at least until you level it up - and simply dodging out of the way of charged attacks and then moving in for some saber and claw strikes feels like much the better option.This same issue extends to the game's deflection system. Time your block with the left shoulder button and you'll deflect an enemy's attack. Fair enough. But the rewards for doing this aren't worth how difficult it is to master the extremely tight and tricky timing - there's no opening up the enemy for a fancy riposte here - and so you're much better off simply dodging out of the way. However, even dodging has its issues, it feels unrefined, and for the most part we chose to hammer the dodge button rather than trying to get into a rhythm of perfect escapes.It all results in combat that feels rather baggy on the defence side of things, never reaching a place where it makes the player feel like they're in total control, weaving in and out of enemy attacks and delivering ripostes when the opportunity arises. In short, on offense Thymesia feels fine for the most part, but outside of this it's a messy bag of mechanics that could, and should, have been streamlined. Take out the feathers and the deflection and just give us plague weapons, saber/claw attacks and a dodge and this may have felt much slicker overall.Outside of combat and, well, you have to take Thymesia's indie nature and budget price point into consideration here. There are just three distinct areas in the game, with a small hub and a final small boss region to bulk things out a tad. Not too much in the way of variety all in all. You'll run through an area once and face off against its boss, then you'll be offered a series of sub-quests that see you return to a slightly different version of that same area to collect something or battle a secondary boss. This amounts to a lot of backtracking and repetition in both scenery and enemy types and it's an issue that's exacerbated early on by a first major boss we needed to grind for a good few hours in order to beat. Yes, Thymesia's first big challenge is a bit of a badly balanced nightmare and we ended up running through the very first area of the game countless times over in order to eventually best him through brute force. Not an ideal start.What's more, once we finally defeated this first big bad, we found ourselves feeling entirely over-levelled for the rest of our adventure. Run-of-the-mill enemies who'd presented a challenge could now be brushed aside, we relied a lot less on plague weapons as simply slashing and clawing easily dispatched most foes, and the energy, immediacy and atmosphere of the game mostly disappeared as we blasted through the rest of the campaign with little trouble outside of boss battles.In terms of these bosses, that very tricky first battle laid bare most of the issues we had with deflecting, dodging and firing off feathers, but then subsequent bosses felt almost too easy, with most of them falling on our second or third attempt. There are some highlights, a face-off against the ferociously fast Urd, and a rather unique God of the Fools battle that requires some platforming, but overall this is a game that feels as though it's lacking balance. It's also a game that fails to deliver on the lore front, there's very little going on story-wise, and level design is also pedestrian stuff involving lots of bland corridors and small areas that very often feel ill-suited to the battles at hand.With a little more polish and refinement in terms of its combat mechanics, more surprises in level layout and more balance with regards to difficulty across the board, Thymesia could well have been a solid indie Soulslike surprise. The essentials are absolutely there, however it just feels too messy, too short and too imbalanced to earn a really solid recommendation this time around. If you're a huge fan of the Soulslike genre this one may still scratch that itch, but overall it's an experience that ended up frustrating us more than anything else.Thymesia has all the ingredients necessary to make for a solid indie Soulslike experience, but it falls short due to messy implementation of mechanics, bland level design, weak lore and issues with difficulty balancing. There are some really neat ideas here, for sure, with the game's plague weapons providing lots of variety in how you go about dealing with your enemies, but unnecessary and awkward elements such as an overly tricky deflection system and dodge mechanics that need tightening up sully the overall combat experience. With a little more TLC this could have been a banger, but as things stand it's a fairly average effort that's hard to recommend if you're not a huge fan of the genre.Not Bad 6/10Scoring PolicyComments (8)If its on Gamepass I'll play it.Shame, I had high hopes for this. Oh well, just gives me more time on Cult of the lamb!Solid 20 dollar romp probably. I’ll cop on sale@Dusk_Actual Yeah, for the right price i think it's prob still worth a look if you're into the genre.@Nightcrawler71 where are you enjoying cult of the lamb? Switch, xbox, steam deck? And how is it, from the management sim side, to the action-y bits.@PhhhCough I bought it on Xbox Series X in the end. It’s has a great gameplay loop, from going on runs (or “crusades” as they are called here) to managing your cult. Lots of things to unlock. It wasn’t even on my radar a week ago, now it’s my go-to game!Nope Hermes don't deliver any moreThe moment you said Soulslike experience it became a pass for me.

       " \"Roundup: Here's What The Critics Think Of Next-Gen RPG ThymesiaGuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpIt's thymeNext-gen Soulslike Thymesia is finally out in the wild, after a fair bit of hype building since the game's initial reveal. Well, the reviews are in, including our own PX take, ahead of public release on Thursday, August 18th.Without further ado, here's what the critics are saying about Thymesia so far:Thymesia has all the ingredients necessary to make for a solid indie Soulslike experience, but it falls short due to messy implementation of mechanics, bland level design, weak lore and issues with difficulty balancing. There are some really neat ideas here, for sure, with the game's plague weapons providing lots of variety in how you go about dealing with your enemies, but unnecessary and awkward elements such as an overly tricky deflection system and dodge mechanics that need tightening up sully the overall combat experience. With a little more TLC this could have been a banger, but as things stand it's a fairly average effort that's hard to recommend if you're not a huge fan of the genre.Still, at 10 hours, Thymesia is short enough that it doesn't overstay its welcome. You wind up feeling more like a general badass than a vastly overpowered killing machine for the most part, and the game's great ideas culminate in some intense, memorable boss fights. While a few elements of the overall experience don't gel, Thymesia understands what matters most about its inspirations, while adding a few spins of its own to create a small, smart, and rewarding Souls-like experience.Thymesia is a confident, good-looking Soulslike that arguably ranks among the best of the non-From Software titles in the genre, but it’s let down by a few issues. The world is fun enough to explore, but a lack of proper narrative and real context harms the atmosphere. Combat, though, is exceptionally good when it works, and it works most of the time. It takes a little patience on the player’s part, but so do all games in this genre. Fans seeking that Soulslike rush will find a lot to like here, though, and it feels different enough to the usual crop to stand out and hold your attention.By now we’re definitely starting to feel the effects of genre fatigue amongst soulslikes. And Thymesia certainly reaches a point where it can’t separate itself from the games that came before. However, there is still a lot of originality in its combat systems and world design so that the game doesn’t feel too derivative. It’s just a shame that clunky controls and awkward bugs hold it back.Thymesia isn’t shy about its influences, an admittance that helps and harms the title when inevitably compared to its legendary brethren. But any Soulslike fan who is willing to look past the budgetary shortcomings will find this modest monster masher a fine way to spend a gloomy weekend. While Thymesia is certainly lacking in some key departments, the solid control, satisfying combat, moody atmosphere, and compelling challenge are still well worth crowing about.You can see the make-up of a good game at the heart of Thymesia, but it seems the team was only capable of delivering a prototype; the building blocks of something greater, before it tapped out. You can easily spend ten-ish hours with the game, and potentially longer if you decide to experiment with builds, but at $25 (or $22.49 with the launch week discount), it might be a hard sell.Thymesia certainly isn’t the worst indie Souls-like money can buy. Especially for its reasonable price point, players get a handful of really fun and challenging boss battles, but I wish the levels in between didn’t come across as filler. Thymesia ends up feeling like Bloodborne’s younger, less-gifted cousin — he may not be all that great, but he still has some redeeming qualities.Thymesiais a shadow. It’s a word which doesn’t just describe its raven-like plague-masked protagonist Corvus, but its beholden nature to the many Soulsborne games which have come before it. It functions, moves, sounds, and reads like those titles in myriad ways, but absent of their artistic detail, careful environmental storytelling, or meaningful depth. What’s left is a bare outline, a third-person action RPG with a minimal skill tree, a slew of broken mechanics, a paltry roster of enemies, and some atrocious boss fights.A bit of a mixed bag then, although generally, reviews are more positive than negative. Our own 6/10 scoring falls close to the MetaCritic average, currently sitting at 69 for Xbox Series X|S at the time of writing. Not too bad then, all things considered!Will you be picking up Thymesia?

When he's not gaming, Ben spends his time listening to way too much Guns N' Roses, watching football and probably eating somewhere.Comments (4)And PushSquare gave it a 3/10 like Screen Rant...Wasn't on my watch list before the reviews came out and nothing I have read in reviews, good or bad, has convinced me to keep my eye out for it in the future (Game Pass. PS+ or when it comes on 'sale' either)Soul Hackers 2 is out in a little over a week. Diofield Chronicles got a demo out last week. Why do we have two headline stories covering a 6/10 reviewed indie nobody's even heard of when there's two reasonably significant Sega/Squeenix titles being almost entirely ignored on PXB? They're not PlayStation exclusives, but you'd think they are if you visit these sites.... I've been looking forward to this for the best part of a year now, and almost bought it yesterday (it had not been available to purchase until then), however, caution got the better of me, and I decided to wait for the reviews to drop. Now I'm glad that I didn't buy it, and I will await user reviews to see whether it gets more favourable reviews. Ultimately, I hope that it ends up on Game Pass, as that would most likely suit be best as is. Very disappointed to see it reviewing so lowly, though...Don't think I will bother...haven't even finished Elden Ring....even though I was really enjoying it I don't think I will ever go back...after you leave a game for a while it's hard to go back...got a few games I need to finish that I can't motivate myself too Tap here to load 4 commentsLeave A CommentHold on there, you need to login to post a comment...Two More Games Added To September 2022's Xbox Game Pass LineupAlong with news of a delaySome Notable Titles Are Leaving Xbox Game Pass This Month (August 31)10 in totalNew Lord Of The Rings Game Announced By 2K Publisher Private DivisionExpected to launch 2023-24Xbox Game Pass Is Hurting Right Now, But Larger Forces Are At PlayAll we need, is just a little patienceFour Games Are Confirmed For Xbox Game Pass In September 2022 So FarUpdate: Make that five!Game ProfileTitle:ThymesiaSystem:Xbox Series X|SAlso Available For:PS5Publisher:Team17Developer:OverBorder StudioGenre:Action, RPGRelease Date:Xbox Series X|SReviews:Review: Thymesia - Sadly, This Soulslike RPG Isn't As Great As It LooksWhere to buy:Buy on Amazon \\n 8Review Thymesia - Sadly, This Soulslike RPG Isn't As Great As It LooksPopular Right NowAll Xbox Games With Mouse & Keyboard Support 2 days agoHow To Complete All Xbox Game Pass Quests In 2022 5 days agoXbox Adds More Perks For Game Pass Ultimate Members (Augu... 2 days agoTwo More Games Added To September 2022's Xbox Game Pass L... 2 days agoFour Games Are Confirmed For Xbox Game Pass In September ...

Nice. I played the demo and it's pretty excellent.Definitely excited for Immortal Fenyx Rising.Three great looking Day One games: Immorality, Tinykin and Midnight Flight Express. And good mix of other games. Make sure you check out Opus.Tinykin and Immortals Fenyx Rising are great additions!Coffee Talk was a surprise, so I gave it a go this morning and picked up all the three achievements for the weekly streak in five minutes! Another game that appears to have been review bombed by idiots.That's a good-looking line-up of games....Immortals fenix rising is rubbish. One of the worst open world games Ive played. Looking forward to Commandos 3 and Midnight express though!@Clankylad Coffee Talk is fantastic. It’s the perfect visual novel for people that don’t quite like visual novels. Really relaxing game.Might give tinykin a try, the rest don't interest me thoughMidnight Fight Express and Immortality have my interest. TMNT Cowabunga Collection will have my time the end of the month, however.Immortals Fenyx Rising is probably my game of this generation thus far (and that includes Elden Ring). Absolutely loved the game. Cannot recommend it enough...The Xbox post hints at more surprise games coming this week, any idea what those might be?Kinda a great batch, IMO. Lots of variety and, in the case of Fenyx Rising, a game I had wanted to play but got washed away by other releases.Fenyx Rising is really fun. Great atmosphere, fun combat, some decent puzzles. Well worth a play.My one criticism is that there are TOO many puzzles in the game. Everything you want to do or collect is gated behind a puzzle, which is fine. But by the end of the game the player is really sick of pushing boulders onto switches over and over.But that is a minor gripe. It is well worth your time, especially if you have gamepass.Immortals ftwDefinitely playing Midnight Fight Express and Immortals Fenyx Rising@funkhouser QuakeCon is this week so maybe thatImmortals fenyx rising feels and plays like a zelda botw-lite, which isnt a bad thing. The humor is subjective. I enjoyed it. Looking forward to midnight fight express. Getting some oldschool beat'em up vibes from it.@Solidchief Oh man. I could really go for Quake II Remastered.@Solidchief That's true! Can't wait to find out what they have in store!@SplooshDmg Same, it's the 25 anniversary of Quake II so there's a chance we could get a remastered version.Glad I didn’t get Immortals Fenyx Rising, now I can continue ignoring on game pass.definetly a good batch of game i am excited about since a long time they finaly heard us 😊👌👍❤️dang it, i own immortals fenyx rising too. ah well, at least i don't have to worry about it being taken off gamepass this wayCoffee Talk used to be on GP and left didn't it? Could have sworn I played it a bit before....@funkhouser Hopefully Goldeneye!Thats a pretty sweet collection of games.

       " \"Grounded Is Receiving Major New 'Shared Worlds' FeatureGuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpCommunal gardensDeveloper Obsidian has announced that it's testing a major new Grounded feature right now. 'Shared Worlds' are being worked on for the studio's garden survival sim, with a wider release expected soon.In short, Shared Worlds provide the option to save your server in the cloud for friends to then download and play on, even when the creator is offline. Think of it like a persistent world that exists even when you log off! Here are the team's patch notes for the feature, currently in testing:You can now create a Shared World as well as the Standard Worlds you have been doing since Game Preview launch. Shared Worlds are stored in the cloud and you can share them with any of your friends so they can host that world while you are not online.-You can own up to three Shared Worlds at any given time.\\n-You can have 50 worlds shared with you at any given time.\\n-Any Standard Worlds from before can be converted to a Shared World via the Save / Load menu.\\n-Any Shared World you own or have been shared with can be copied down as a local Standard World for you to play on your own.\\n-Shared Worlds can only be played by hosting it as a Multiplayer game.\\n-Only one person can host a Shared World at a time (others will be able to join the current player who is hosting).\\n-Any game progress that happens while anyone is hosting a Shared World will be properly restored regardless of who hosts the world next.-Owner of Shared World who is hosting can logout for the day and have someone else who has the world shared with them re-host it while they are offline.\\n-You can use this system to share copies of save games with friends: Create a Shared copy of an existing world, share it with said friend, have them download a Standard copy of it on their end.\\n-If you own both a Steam copy and an Xbox / Windows Store copy, you can use this system to have a single Shared world that you can play through across all platforms.NOTE: This feature is considered beta and could have issues and could require online shared saves to be reset / lost as bugs are ironed out. If you test this feature out with a save with lots of progress, make sure it is not the only working copy of the world you have on your account. The shared save service could also go offline at any time during this testing phase to account for issues or updates as needed.Does this sound like a good feature for Grounded?

Minecraft should have implemented this ages ago.Awesome. I've been wanting something like this for a long time. I didn't like having the world forever linked to the host. I wanted my friends to be able to build the base while I was away and vise versa. Grounded is a very good game.Super excited for the release. Shared worlds is going to definitely help bring some of my friends over. Can see really could implantation and really crazy worlds in the future.So it's like when we would build a clubhouse at my grandma's when I was a kid, and then I'd go back a few days later to see my cousins had gone over and f*** it all up.Can't wait to relive those memories!

      "Premier League\n",
      "The Premier League (legal name: The Football Association Premier League Limited), is the top level of the men's English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). Seasons typically run from August to May with each team playing 38 matches (playing all 19 other teams both home and away).[1] Most games are played on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, with occasional weekday evening fixtures.[2]\n",
      "The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992 following the decision of clubs in the Football League First Division to break away from the Football League, founded in 1888, and take advantage of a lucrative television rights sale to Sky.[3] From 2019 to 2020, the league's accumulated television rights deals were worth around £3.1 billion a year, with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 128 and 32 games respectively.[4][5] The Premier League is a corporation where chief executive Richard Masters is responsible for its management, whilst the member clubs act as shareholders.[6] Clubs were apportioned central payment revenues of £2.4 billion in 2016–17, with a further £343 million in solidarity payments to English Football League (EFL) clubs.[7]\n",
      "The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.[8][9] For the 2018–19 season, the average Premier League match attendance was at 38,181,[10] second to the German Bundesliga's 43,500,[11] while aggregated attendance across all matches is the highest of any association football league at 14,508,981.[12] Most stadium occupancies are near capacity.[13] The Premier League ranks first in the UEFA coefficients of leagues based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons as of 2021.[14] The English top-flight has produced the second-highest number of UEFA Champions League/European Cup titles, with five English clubs having won fourteen European trophies in total.[15]\n",
      "Fifty clubs have competed since the inception of the Premier League in 1992: forty-eight English and two Welsh clubs. Seven of them have won the title: Manchester United (13), Manchester City (6), Chelsea (5), Arsenal (3), Blackburn Rovers (1), Leicester City (1) and Liverpool (1).[16]\n",
      "Despite significant European success in the 1970s and early 1980s, the late 1980s marked a low point for English football. Stadiums were crumbling, supporters endured poor facilities, hooliganism was rife, and English clubs had been banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium disaster in 1985.[17] The Football League First Division, the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga in attendances and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.[18]\n",
      "By the turn of the 1990s, the downward trend was starting to reverse. At the 1990 FIFA World Cup, England reached the semi-finals; UEFA, European football's governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990, resulting in Manchester United lifting the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1991. The Taylor Report on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadiums in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster, was published in January 1990.[19]\n",
      "During the 1980s, major English clubs had begun to transform into business ventures, applying commercial principles to club administration to maximise revenue. Martin Edwards of Manchester United, Irving Scholar of Tottenham Hotspur, and David Dein of Arsenal were among the leaders in this transformation.[20] The commercial imperative led to the top clubs seeking to increase their power and revenue: the clubs in Division One threatened to break away from the Football League, and in so doing they managed to increase their voting power and gain a more favourable financial arrangement, taking a 50% share of all television and sponsorship income in 1986.[20] They demanded that television companies should pay more for their coverage of football matches,[21] and revenue from television grew in importance. The Football League received £6.3 million for a two-year agreement in 1986, but by 1988, in a deal agreed with ITV, the price rose to £44 million over four years with the leading clubs taking 75% of the cash.[22][23] According to Scholar, who was involved in the negotiations of television deals, each of the First Division clubs received only around £25,000 per year from television rights before 1986, this increased to around £50,000 in the 1986 negotiation, then to £600,000 in 1988.[24] The 1988 negotiations were conducted under the threat of ten clubs leaving to form a \"super league\", but they were eventually persuaded to stay, with the top clubs taking the lion's share of the deal.[22][25][26] The negotiations also convinced the bigger clubs that in order to receive enough votes, they needed to take the whole of First Division with them instead of a smaller \"super league\".[27] By the beginning of the 1990s, the big clubs again considered breaking away, especially now that they had to fund the cost of stadium upgrade as proposed by the Taylor Report.[28]\n",
      "In 1990, the managing director of London Weekend Television (LWT), Greg Dyke, met with the representatives of the \"big five\" football clubs in England (Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Everton and Arsenal) over a dinner.[29] The meeting was to pave the way for a breakaway from The Football League.[30] Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money.[31] The five clubs agreed with the suggestion and decided to press ahead with it; however, the league would have no credibility without the backing of The Football Association, and so David Dein of Arsenal held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea. The FA did not enjoy an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and considered it as a way to weaken the Football League's position.[32] The FA released a report in June 1991, Blueprint for the Future of Football, that supported the plan for the Premier League with the FA as the ultimate authority that would oversee the breakaway league.[27]\n",
      "At the close of the 1990–1991 season, a proposal was tabled for the establishment of a new league that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991 by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League.[33] The newly formed top division was to have commercial independence from The Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe.[18] Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, he and ITV (of which LWT was part) lost out in the bidding for broadcast rights: BSkyB won with a bid of £304 million over five years, with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on Match of the Day.[29][31]\n",
      "The First Division clubs resigned en masse from the Football League in 1992, and on 27 May that year the FA Premier League was formed as a limited company, working out of an office at the Football Association's then headquarters in Lancaster Gate.[18] The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were:[34]\n",
      "This meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three. There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained the same as the old First and Second Divisions with three teams relegated from the league and three promoted.[26]\n",
      "The league held its first season in 1992–93. It was composed of 22 clubs for that season (reduced to 20 in the 1995–96 season). The first Premier League goal was scored by Brian Deane of Sheffield United in a 2–1 win against Manchester United.[35]\n",
      "Luton Town, Notts County, and West Ham United were the three teams relegated from the old First Division at the end of the 1991–92 season, and did not take part in the inaugural Premier League season.[36]\n",
      "The 2000s saw the dominance of the so-called \"Top Four\" clubs. Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United[37][38] finished at the top of the table for bulk of the decade, thereby guaranteeing qualification for the UEFA Champions League. Only four other clubs managed to qualify for the competition during this period: Leeds United (2000–01), Newcastle United (2001–02 and 2002–03), Everton (2004–05) and Tottenham Hotspur (2009–10) – each occupying the final Champions League spot, with the exception of Newcastle in the 2002–03 season, who finished third.\n",
      "Following the 2003–04 season, Arsenal acquired the nickname \"The Invincibles\" as it became the first, and to date, only club to complete a Premier League campaign without losing a single game.[39][40]\n",
      "In May 2008, Kevin Keegan stated that \"Top Four\" dominance threatened the division: \"This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world.\"[41] Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said in defence: \"There are a lot of different tussles that go on in the Premier League depending on whether you're at the top, in the middle or at the bottom that make it interesting.\"[42]\n",
      "Between 2005 and 2012 there was a Premier League representative in seven of the eight Champions League finals, with only \"Top Four\" clubs reaching that stage. Liverpool (2005), Manchester United (2008) and Chelsea (2012) won the competition during this period, with Arsenal (2006), Liverpool (2007), Chelsea (2008) and Manchester United (2009 and 2011) all losing Champions League finals.[43] Leeds United were the only non-\"Top Four\" side to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League, in the 2000–01 season. There were three Premier League teams in the Champions League semi-finals in 2006–07, 2007–08, and 2008–09, a feat only ever achieved five times (along with Serie A in 2002–03 and La Liga in 1999–2000).\n",
      "Additionally, between the 1999–2000 and 2009–10 seasons, four Premier League sides reached UEFA Cup or Europa League finals, with only Liverpool managing to win the competition in 2001. Arsenal (2000), Middlesbrough (2006) and Fulham (2010) all lost their finals.[44]\n",
      "Although the group's dominance was reduced to a degree after this period with the emergence of Manchester City and Tottenham, in terms of all time Premier League points won they remain clear by some margin. As of the end of the 2018–19 season – the 27th season of the Premier League – Liverpool, in fourth place in the all-time points table, were over 250 points ahead of the next team, Tottenham Hotspur. They are also the only teams to maintain a winning average of over 50% throughout their entire Premier League tenures.[45]\n",
      "The years following 2009 marked a shift in the structure of the \"Top Four\" with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City both breaking into the top four places on a regular basis, turning the \"Top Four\" into the \"Big Six\".[46] In the 2009–10 season, Tottenham finished fourth and became the first team to break the top four since Everton five years prior.[47] Criticism of the gap between an elite group of \"super clubs\" and the majority of the Premier League has continued, nevertheless, due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier League clubs.[48] Manchester City won the title in the 2011–12 season, becoming the first club outside the \"Big Four\" to win since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–95 season. That season also saw two of the \"Big Four\" (Chelsea and Liverpool) finish outside the top four places for the first time since that season.[46]\n",
      "With only four UEFA Champions League qualifying places available in the league, greater competition for qualification now exists, albeit from a narrow base of six clubs. In the five seasons following the 2011–12 campaign, Manchester United and Liverpool both found themselves outside of the top four three times, while Chelsea finished 10th in the 2015–16 season. Arsenal finished 5th in 2016–17, ending their record run of 20 consecutive top-four finishes.[49]\n",
      "In the 2015–16 season, the top four was breached by a non-Big Six side for the first time since Everton in 2005. Leicester City were the surprise winners of the league, qualifying for the Champions League as a result.[50]\n",
      "Off the pitch, the \"Big Six\" wield significant financial power and influence, with these clubs arguing that they should be entitled to a greater share of revenue due to the greater stature of their clubs globally and the attractive football they aim to play.[51] Objectors argue that the egalitarian revenue structure in the Premier League helps to maintain a competitive league which is vital for its future success.[52] The 2016–17 Deloitte Football Money League report showed the financial disparity between the \"Big Six\" and the rest of the division. All of the \"Big Six\" had revenues greater than €350 million, with Manchester United having the largest revenue in the league at €676.3 million. Leicester City was the closest club to the \"Big Six\" in terms of revenue, recording a figure of €271.1 million for that season – helped by participation in the Champions League. The eighth-largest revenue generator, West Ham – who did not play in European competition – had revenues of €213.3 million, nearly half of those of the club with the fifth-largest revenue, Liverpool (€424.2 million).[53] A substantial part of the clubs' revenue by then came from television broadcast deals, with the biggest clubs each taking from around £150 million to nearly £200 million in the 2016–17 season from such deals.[54] In Deloitte's 2019 report, all the \"Big Six\" were in the top ten of the world's richest clubs.[55]\n",
      "From the 2019–20 season, video assistant referees were used in the league.[56]\n",
      "Project Big Picture was announced in October 2020 that described a plan to reunite the top Premier League clubs with the English Football League, proposed by leading Premier League clubs Manchester United and Liverpool.[57] It has been criticised by the Premier League leadership and the UK government's Department of Culture, Media and Sport.[58]\n",
      "On 26 April 2021, play was stopped during a match between Leicester City and Crystal Palace to allow players Wesley Fofana and Cheikhou Kouyaté to break Ramadan fast. It is believed to be the first time in Premier League history that a game was paused to allow Muslim players to eat and drink after the sun had set in accordance with the rules of the faith.[59]\n",
      "The 2022–23 season will be the first to take a six-week break between November and December 2022 to allow for the first winter World Cup,[60] with a return for the Boxing Day fixtures.[61] The Premier League players decided to take the knee only at some selected “significant moments”, instead of the routine before matches. However, they assured to “remain resolutely committed to eradicate racial prejudice”.[62]\n",
      "The Football Association Premier League Ltd (FAPL)[63][64][65] is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs. Each club is a shareholder, with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts. The clubs elect a chairman, chief executive, and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league.[66] The Football Association is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league.[67]\n",
      "The current chief executive is Richard Masters, who was appointed in December 2019,[68] and the chairman is Gary Hoffman, appointed in April 2020.[69] Both men succeeded Richard Scudamore, who held the combined position of \"Executive Chairman\" from November 1999 until his retirement in November 2019.[69]\n",
      "The Premier League sends representatives to UEFA's European Club Association, the number of clubs and the clubs themselves chosen according to UEFA coefficients. For the 2012–13 season the Premier League has 10 representatives in the Association: Arsenal, Aston Villa, Chelsea, Everton, Fulham, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur.[70] The European Club Association is responsible for electing three members to UEFA's Club Competitions Committee, which is involved in the operations of UEFA competitions such as the Champions League and UEFA Europa League.[71]\n",
      "The Premier League has faced criticism of its governance due to an alleged lack of transparency and accountability.\n",
      "Following the Premier League's blocking of the attempted takeover of Newcastle United by a PIF-backed consortium through the league's Owners' and Directors' test, many MPs, Newcastle United fans and related parties to the deal denounced the Premier League for its perceived lack of transparency and accountability throughout the process.[72][73][74] On 6 July 2021, consortium member Amanda Staveley of PCP Capital Partners said that \"fans surely deserve absolute transparency from the regulators across all their processes – to best ensure that they act responsibly. They (the Premier League) are performing a function like that of a government regulator – but without the same systems for accountability.\"[74]\n",
      "On 22 July 2021, Tracey Crouch MP – chair of the fan-led review into the UK's football governance – announced in the review's interim findings that the Premier League had \"lost the trust and confidence\" of fans. The review also recommended that a new independent regulator be created to oversee matters such as club takeovers.[75][76]\n",
      "Premier League chief executive Richard Masters had earlier spoken out against the implementation of an independent regulator, saying in May 2021, \"I don’t think that the independent regulator is the answer to the question. I would defend the Premier League's role as regulator of its clubs over the past 30 years.\"[77]\n",

      "There are 20 clubs in the Premier League. During the course of a season (from August to May) each club plays the others twice (a double round-robin system), once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for 38 games. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, the head-to-head record between the tied teams is taken into consideration (points scored in the matches between the teams, followed by away goals in those matches.) If two teams are still tied, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank.[80]\n",
      "A system of promotion and relegation exists between the Premier League and the EFL Championship. The three lowest placed teams in the Premier League are relegated to the Championship, and the top two teams from the Championship promoted to the Premier League,[81] with an additional team promoted after a series of play-offs involving the third, fourth, fifth and sixth placed clubs.[82] The number of clubs was reduced from 22 to 20 in 1995, when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted.[83][84] The top flight had only been expanded to 22 teams at the start of the 1991–92 season – the year prior to the formation of the Premier League.[84]\n",
      "On 8 June 2006, FIFA requested that all major European leagues, including Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga, be reduced to 18 teams by the start of the 2007–08 season. The Premier League responded by announcing their intention to resist such a reduction.[85] Ultimately, the 2007–08 season kicked off again with 20 teams.[86]\n",

      "In 2011, after Swansea City gained promotion, a Welsh club participated in the Premier League for the first time.[89][90] The first Premier League match to be played outside England was Swansea City's home match at the Liberty Stadium against Wigan Athletic on 20 August 2011.[91] The number of Welsh clubs in the Premier League increased to two in 2013–14, as Cardiff City gained promotion,[92] but they were relegated after their maiden season.[93] Cardiff were promoted again in 2017–18 but the number of Welsh clubs remained the same for the 2018–19 Premier League season, as Swansea City had been relegated from the Premier League in 2017–18.[94] Following Cardiff City's relegation after the 2018–19 season, there are currently no Welsh clubs participating in the Premier League.[95]\n",
      "Because they are members of the Football Association of Wales (FAW), the question of whether clubs like Swansea should represent England or Wales in European competitions has caused long-running discussions in UEFA. Swansea took one of England's three available places in the Europa League in 2013–14 by winning the League Cup in 2012–13.[96] The right of Welsh clubs to take up such English places was in doubt until UEFA clarified the matter in March 2012, allowing them to participate.[97]\n",
      "Participation in the Premier League by some Scottish or Irish clubs has sometimes been discussed, but without result. The idea came closest to reality in 1998, when Wimbledon received Premier League approval to relocate to Dublin, Ireland, but the move was blocked by the Football Association of Ireland.[98][99][100][101] Additionally, the media occasionally discusses the idea that Scotland's two biggest teams, Celtic and Rangers, should or will take part in the Premier League, but nothing has come of these discussions.[102]\n",
      "The top four teams in the Premier League qualify automatically for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League group stage. The winners of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League may earn an additional qualification for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League group stage if they are not in the top four. If this means six Premier League teams qualify, then the fourth-placed team in the Premier League instead plays in the UEFA Europa League, for any single nation is limited to a maximum of five teams in UCL.\n",
      "The fifth-placed team in the Premier League, as well as the winner of the FA Cup, qualifies for the subsequent season's UEFA Europa League group stage, but if the winner also finished in the top five places in the Premier League or has won one of UEFA's major tournaments, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth. The winner of the EFL Cup qualifies for the subsequent season's UEFA Europa League second qualifying round, but if the winner already qualified for a UEFA competition via their performance in another competition, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth in the Premier League, or seventh if the FA Cup result already caused the sixth-placed team to qualify.[103]\n",
      "The number of places allocated to English clubs in UEFA competitions is dependent upon the position a country holds in the UEFA country coefficients, which are calculated based upon the performance of teams in UEFA competitions in the previous five years. Currently the ranking of England (and de facto the Premier League) is second, behind Spain.\n",
      "An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.[105] UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. At that time, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League.[106] This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea – who had won the Champions League that summer, but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa League.[107]\n",
      "From 2015–16, the Europa League winners qualify for the Champions League, increasing the maximum number of participants per country to five.[108] This took effect in England in 2016–17, when Manchester United finished sixth in the Premier League and won the Europa League, giving England five Champions League entrants for 2017–18.[109] In these instances, any Europa League berth vacated will not be handed down to the next-best Premier League finisher outside a qualifying place and so the association's Europa League entrants for the following season will be reduced. If it happens that both Champions League and Europa League winners are of the same association and both finish outside the top four, then the fourth-placed team will be transferred to the Europa League.\n",
      "Between the 1992–93 and the 2021–22 seasons, Premier League clubs won the UEFA Champions League six times (and had eight runners-up), behind Spain's La Liga with twelve wins, and ahead of, among others, Italy's Serie A with five wins and Germany's Bundesliga with four wins.[43] The FIFA Club World Cup (originally called the FIFA Club World Championship) has been won three times by a Premier League club (Manchester United in 2008, Liverpool in 2019, and Chelsea in 2021),[110] with two runners-up (Liverpool in 2005 and Chelsea in 2012),[111][112] behind Spain's La Liga with seven wins[113] and Brazil's Brasileirão with four wins.[111][112][114][115]\n",
      "The league changed its name from the FA Premier League to simply the Premier League in 2007.[116] From 1993 to 2016, the Premier League had title sponsorship rights sold to two companies, which were Carling brewery and Barclays Bank PLC; Barclays was the most recent title sponsor, having sponsored the Premier League from 2001 until 2016 (until 2004, the title sponsorship was held through its Barclaycard brand before shifting to its main banking brand in 2004).[117]\n",
      "Barclays' deal with the Premier League expired at the end of the 2015–16 season. The FA announced on 4 June 2015 that it would not pursue any further title sponsorship deals for the Premier League, arguing that they wanted to build a \"clean\" brand for the competition more in line with those of major U.S. sports leagues.[119]\n",
      "As well as sponsorship for the league itself, the Premier League has a number of official partners and suppliers.[120] The official ball supplier for the league is Nike who have had the contract since the 2000–01 season when they took over from Mitre.[121] Under its Merlin brand, Topps held the licence to produce collectables for the Premier League between 1994 and 2019 including stickers (for their sticker album) and trading cards.[122] Launched in the 2007–08 season, Topps’ Match Attax, the official Premier League trading card game, is the best selling boys collectable in the UK, and is also the biggest selling sports trading card game in the world.[122][123] In October 2018, Panini were awarded the licence to produce collectables from the 2019–20 season.[124] The chocolate company Cadbury has been the official snack partner of the Premier League since 2017, and sponsored the Golden Boot, Golden Glove and Playmaker of the Season awards from the 2017–18 season to 2019–20 season.[125][126] The Coca-Cola Company (under its Coca-Cola Zero Sugar product line) sponsored these awards during the 2020–21 season with Castrol being the current sponsor as of the 2021–22 season.\n",
      "The Premier League has the highest revenue of any association football league in the world, with total club revenues of €2.48 billion in 2009–10.[127][128] In 2013–14, due to improved television revenues and cost controls, the Premier League clubs collectively made a net profit in excess of £78 million, exceeding all other football leagues.[129] In 2010 the Premier League was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to English football and the United Kingdom's broadcasting industry.[130]\n",
      "The Premier League includes some of the richest football clubs in the world. Deloitte's \"Football Money League\" listed seven Premier League clubs in the top 20 for the 2009–10 season,[131] and all 20 clubs were in the top 40 globally by the end of the 2013–14 season, largely as a result of increased broadcasting revenue.[132] In 2019, the league generated around £3.1 billion per year in domestic and international television rights.[4]\n",
      "Premier League clubs agreed in principle in December 2012, to radical new cost controls. The two proposals consist of a break-even rule and a cap on the amount clubs can increase their wage bill by each season. With the new television deals on the horizon, momentum has been growing to find ways of preventing the majority of the cash going straight to players and agents.[133]\n",
      "Central payments for the 2016–17 season amounted to £2,398,515,773 across the 20 clubs, with each team receiving a flat participation fee of £35,301,989 and additional payments for TV broadcasts (£1,016,690 for general UK rights to match highlights, £1,136,083 for each live UK broadcast of their games and £39,090,596 for all overseas rights), commercial rights (a flat fee of £4,759,404) and a notional measure of \"merit\" which was based upon final league position.[7] The merit component was a nominal sum of £1,941,609 multiplied by each finishing place, counted from the foot of the table (e.g., Burnley finished 16th in May 2017, five places counting upwards, and received 5 × £1,941,609 = £9,708,045 merit payment).[7]\n",
      "Since its split with the Football League, established clubs in the Premier League have a funding disparity from counterparts in lower leagues. Revenue from television rights between the leagues has played a part in this.[134]\n",
      "Promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first Premier League season. One Premier League newcomer has been relegated back to the Football League every season, save the 2001–02, 2011–12 and 2017–18 seasons. In the 1997–98 season, all three promoted clubs were relegated by the season's end.[135]\n",
      "The Premier League distributes a portion of its television revenue as \"parachute payments\" to relegated clubs for adjustment to television revenue loss. The average Premier League team receives £41 million[136] while the average Championship club receives £2 million.[137] Starting with the 2013–14 season, these payments are in excess of £60 million over four seasons.[138] Critics maintain that the payments widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not,[139] leading to the common occurrence of teams \"bouncing back\" soon after their relegation.\n",
      "Clubs which have failed to win immediate promotion back to the Premier League have seen financial problems, in some cases administration or liquidation. Further relegations down the footballing ladder have occurred for multiple clubs unable to cope with the gap.[140][141]\n",
      "Television has played a major role in the history of the Premier League. The League's decision to assign broadcasting rights to BSkyB in 1992 was at the time a radical decision, but one that has paid off. At the time pay television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market, as was charging fans to watch live televised football. However, a combination of Sky's strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar.[23]\n",
      "The Premier League sells its television rights on a collective basis. This is in contrast to some other European leagues, including La Liga, in which each club sells its rights individually, leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs.[142] The money is divided into three parts:[143] half is divided equally between the clubs; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position, the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club, and equal steps all the way down the table; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television, with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this. The income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs.[144]\n",
      "Not all Premier League matches are televised in the United Kingdom, as the league upholds the long-standing prohibition on telecasts of any association football match (domestic or otherwise) that kicks off between 2:45 p.m. and 5:15 p.m. on Saturday matchdays.[145][146][147]\n",
      "The first Sky television rights agreement was worth £304 million over five seasons.[148] The next contract, negotiated to start from the 1997–98 season, rose to £670 million over four seasons.[148] The third contract was a £1.024 billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001 to 2002 to 2003–04. The league brought in £320 million from the sale of its international rights for the three-year period from 2004 to 2005 to 2006–07. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis.[149] Sky's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid £1.7 billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3 pm match solely for Irish viewers. The BBC has retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on Match of the Day) for £171.6 million, a 63 per cent increase on the £105 million it paid for the previous three-year period.[150] Sky and BT have agreed to jointly pay £84.3 million for delayed television rights to 242 games (that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10 pm on matchday.[151] Overseas television rights fetched £625 million, nearly double the previous contract.[152] The total raised from these deals is more than £2.7 billion, giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around £40 million-a-year from 2007 to 2010.[153]\n",
      "The TV rights agreement between the Premier League and Sky has faced accusations of being a cartel, and a number of court cases have arisen as a result.[154] An investigation by the Office of Fair Trading in 2002 found BSkyB to be dominant within the pay TV sports market, but concluded that there were insufficient grounds for the claim that BSkyB had abused its dominant position.[155] In July 1999 the Premier League's method of selling rights collectively for all member clubs was investigated by the UK Restrictive Practices Court, which concluded that the agreement was not contrary to the public interest.[156]\n",
      "The BBC's highlights package on Saturday and Sunday nights, as well as other evenings when fixtures justify, will run until 2016.[157] Television rights alone for the period 2010 to 2013 have been purchased for £1.782 billion.[158] On 22 June 2009, due to troubles encountered by Setanta Sports after it failed to meet a final deadline over a £30 million payment to the Premier League, ESPN was awarded two packages of UK rights containing 46 matches that were available for the 2009–10 season as well as a package of 23 matches per season from 2010 to 2011 to 2012–13.[159] On 13 June 2012, the Premier League announced that BT had been awarded 38 games a season for the 2013–14, 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons at £246 million-a-year. The remaining 116 games were retained by Sky, which paid £760 million-a-year. The total domestic rights have raised £3.018 billion, an increase of 70.2% over the 2010–11 to 2012–13 rights.[160] The value of the licensing deal rose by another 70.2% in 2015, when Sky and BT paid £5.136 billion to renew their contracts with the Premier League for another three years up to the 2018–19 season.[161]\n",
      "A new rights cycle began in the 2019–20 season, with the domestic package increasing to 200 matches overall; in February 2018, BT were awarded the package of 32 lunchtime fixtures on Saturdays, while Sky was awarded four of the seven packages, covering the majority of weekend fixtures (including eight new prime time fixtures on Saturdays), as well as Monday and Friday matches. Two remaining packages of 20 fixtures each were to be sold at a later date, including three rounds of mid-week fixtures and a bank holiday round. As Sky already owned the maximum number of matches it could hold without breaching a 148-match cap, it was speculated that at least one of the new packages could go to a new entrant, such as a streaming service. The five packages sold to BT and Sky were valued at £4.464 billion.[162] In June 2018, it was announced that Amazon Prime Video and BT had acquired the remaining two packages; Amazon acquired rights to 20 matches per-season, covering a mid-week round in December, and all Boxing Day fixtures.[163] The Amazon telecasts are produced in association with Sunset + Vine and BT Sport.[164]\n",
      "With the resumption of play in the 2019–20 Premier League due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the Premier League announced that all remaining matches would be carried on British television, split primarily across Sky, BT, and Amazon. A large number of these matches were also scheduled for free-to-air broadcasts, with Sky airing 25 on Pick, Amazon streaming its four matches on Twitch, and the BBC – for the first time in league history – carrying four live matches.[165][166][167][168]\n",
      "As matches would continue to be played without spectators upon the start of the 2020–21 Premier League, its clubs voted on 8 September to continue broadcasting all matches through at least September (with the BBC and Amazon each holding one additional match), and \"appropriate arrangements\" being made for October.[169][170] It was later announced that matches not selected for broadcast would be carried on pay-per-view via BT Sport Box Office and Sky Box Office at a cost of £14.95 per-match. The PPV scheme was poorly received; the Football Supporters' Federation felt that the price was too high, and there were concerns that it could encourage piracy. There were calls from supporters to boycott the pay-per-views, and make donations to support charitable causes instead (with Newcastle's \"Charity Not PPV\" campaign raising £20,000 for a local food bank, and Arsenal fans raising £34,000 for Islington Giving). On 13 November, amid the reintroduction of measures across the UK, the Premier League officially announced that the non-televised matches would be assigned to its main broadcast partners, and again including additional matches for the BBC and Amazon.[171][172][173][174]\n",

Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis.[224] As of the 2010–11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances.[225][226] This was to enable the \"home grown\" rule to be enacted, whereby the Premier League would also from 2010 require at least eight members of the named 25-man squad to be \"home-grown players\".[225]\n",
      "At the inception of the Premier League in 1992–93, just 11 players named in the starting line-ups for the first round of matches hailed from outside of the United Kingdom or Ireland.[227] By 2000–01, the number of foreign players participating in the Premier League was 36% of the total. In the 2004–05 season, the figure had increased to 45%. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became the first Premier League side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up,[228] and on 14 February 2005, Arsenal were the first to name a completely foreign 16-man squad for a match.[229] By 2009, under 40% of the players in the Premier League were English.[230] By February 2020, 117 different nationalities had played in the Premier League, and 101 nationalities had scored in the competition.[231]\n",
      "In 1999, in response to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young English players in favour of foreign players, the Home Office tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the European Union.[232] A non-EU player applying for the permit must have played for his country in at least 75 per cent of its competitive 'A' team matches for which he was available for selection during the previous two years, and his country must have averaged at least 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings over the previous two years. If a player does not meet those criteria, the club wishing to sign him may appeal.[233]\n",

      "The Premier League Golden Boot is awarded each season to the top scorer in the division. Former Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer holds the record for most Premier League goals with 260.[238] Thirty-three players have reached the 100-goal mark.[239] Since the first Premier League season in 1992–93, 23 players from 11 clubs have won or shared the top scorer title.[240] Thierry Henry won his fourth overall scoring title by scoring 27 goals in the 2005–06 season. Andrew Cole and Alan Shearer hold the record for most goals in a season (34) – for Newcastle and Blackburn respectively.[241] Ryan Giggs of Manchester United holds the record for scoring goals in consecutive seasons, having scored in the first 21 seasons of the league.[242] Giggs also holds the record for the most Premier League assists, with 162.[243]\n",
      "There is no team or individual salary cap in the Premier League. As a result of the increasingly lucrative television deals, player wages rose sharply following the formation of the Premier League, when the average player wage was £75,000 per year.[244] In the 2018–19 season the average annual salary stood at £2.99 million.\n",
      "The total salary bill for the 20 Premier League clubs in the 2018–19 season was £1.62 billion; this compares to £1.05 billion in La Liga, £0.83 billion in Serie A, £0.72 billion in Bundesliga, and £0.54 billion in Ligue 1. The club with the highest average wage is Manchester United at £6.5 million. This is smaller than the club with the highest wage bill in Spain (Barcelona £10.5 million) and Italy (Juventus £6.7 million), but higher than in Germany (Bayern Munich £6.4 million) and France (Paris Saint-Germain £6.1 million). For the 2018–19 season, the ratio of the wages of the highest-paid team to lowest-paid in the Premier League is 6.82 to 1. This is much lower than in La Liga (19.1 to 1), Serie A (16 to 1), Bundesliga (20.5 to 1), and Ligue 1 (26.6 to 1). Because of the lower differential between team wage bills in the Premier League, it is often regarded as being more competitive than other top European leagues.[245]\n",
      "The record transfer fee for a Premier League player has risen steadily over the lifetime of the competition. Before the start of the first Premier League season, Alan Shearer became the first British player to command a transfer fee of more than £3 million.[246] The record has increased steadily and Philippe Coutinho is now the most expensive transfer involving a Premier League club at £106 million. The highest transfer fee paid by a Premier League club is £100 million for Jack Grealish.\n",

Two trophies are held for the purpose of making the award within minutes of the title being secured, in the event that on the final day of the season two clubs are still within reach of winning the League.[272] In the rare event that more than two clubs are vying for the title on the final day of the season, a replica won by a previous club is used.[273]\n",

The plinth weighs 33 pounds (15 kg) and the trophy weighs 22 pounds (10.0 kg).[274] The trophy and plinth are 76 cm (30 in) tall, 43 cm (17 in) wide and 25 cm (9.8 in) deep.[275]\n",
      "Its main body is solid sterling silver and silver gilt, while its plinth is made of malachite, a semi-precious stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which the names of the title-winning clubs are listed. The green of the malachite represents the green field of play.[275] The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles on either side of the trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season.[276] The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year. In 2004, a special gold version of the trophy was commissioned to commemorate Arsenal winning the title without a single defeat.[277]\n",

      "1992–93 FA Premier League\n",
      "The 1992–93 FA Premier League was the inaugural season of the Premier League, the top division of English football. The season began on 15 August 1992 and ended on 11 May 1993. The league was made up of the 22 clubs that broke away from The Football League at the end of the 1991–92 season. The new league was backed up by a five-year, £305 million deal with Sky to televise Premier League matches. In concept, the Premier League was identical to the old First Division of the Football League, which was now reduced to three divisions.\n",
      "In May 1992–93, the breakaway league signed a broadcasting rights contract with Sky and the BBC valued at £304 million, the largest such agreement in the history of British sport.[2] The league's executive committee was unable, however, to secure title sponsorship for the new competition after eight clubs blocked a proposed £13 million deal with brewers Bass.[3] Nonetheless, clubs began to utilise their dramatically increased wealth to fund a series of high-profile transfers.[4]\n",
      "Although the idea of a super league had been mentioned by football's governing bodies and evaluated by the media since the mid 1980s, plans for a new Premier League of 22 clubs were first unveiled by the Football Association in October 1990, and included in the Football Association's Blueprint for the Future of Football, published in June 1991.[5] The majority of First Division clubs, particularly long-established top clubs including Arsenal and Manchester United, were in favour of a breakaway from the Football League, although Football League president Bill Fox criticised the planned Premier League as an attempt by the Football Association to \"hijack\" the First Division. \n",
      "Shortly before the season began, newly promoted Blackburn Rovers signed Southampton's 21-year-old England international striker Alan Shearer for a new British record fee variously reported as £3.3 million,[6] £3.4 million,[7] or £3.6 million.[8] Several other players moved for fees of £2 million or more, including Arsenal's David Rocastle, who joined Leeds United,[9] Dean Saunders, who moved from Liverpool to Aston Villa,[10] and Teddy Sheringham, who left Nottingham Forest for Tottenham Hotspur.[11]\n",
      "The structure of the new league was identical to that of the previous season's Football League First Division, comprising 22 teams, with each playing the other 21 twice for a total of 42 matches. Ipswich Town and Middlesbrough had been promoted from the old Second Division as champions and runners-up respectively, and Blackburn Rovers took the third promotion place after winning the 1991–92 Second Division playoff.[12]\n",
      "The first Premier League title went to Manchester United, the club's first title for 26 years. Their title was achieved with a 10-point lead over runners-up Aston Villa. Norwich City led the table for much of the season, but their challenge faded in the final weeks of the season and were out of contention three games before the season was over after they lost 3–1 to Ipswich Town. Norwich did however finish in third place, achieving European qualification in Mike Walker's debut season as manager; with a goal difference of −4, this is the highest Premier League finish by a team with a negative goal difference. Blackburn, in the top division for the first time in almost 30 years, finished in fourth place. They briefly led the league early in the season, but suffered a shortage of goals after Alan Shearer, who had scored 16 times before the turn of the year, suffered a torn cruciate ligament and missed the second half of the season. The title race was largely between the clubs who finished in the top four after early challenges from the likes of Arsenal, Coventry City, and Queens Park Rangers were not sustained.\n",
      "Nottingham Forest's league form had suffered through the sale of key players like Des Walker and Teddy Sheringham, and they were bottom of the Premier League for much of the 1992–93 season. Their relegation was confirmed in early May when they lost to Sheffield United, and manager Brian Clough announced his retirement after 18 years as manager, which had yielded one league title, two European Cups and four League Cups. Next to go were newly promoted Middlesbrough, who fell from mid-table at Christmas to go down in second from bottom place. Last to go down were Crystal Palace, who failed to win their final game of the season which would have instead consigned Oldham Athletic to the final relegation place - Oldham's survival was secured with a thrilling 4–3 win over Southampton.[13]\n",
      "Title holders Leeds United finished 17th, which was the lowest finish from a defending league champion since Ipswich Town finished 17th in 1962–63 after having won the title in 1961–62, and the lowest any top tier champions have so far finished in the Premier League. Leeds failed to win an away game in the league. The lowest a defending champion has finished since then has been 12th (Leicester City in 2016–17, having won the title in 2015–16).[14]\n",
      "The top scorer in the new Premier League was Teddy Sheringham, who found the net for Nottingham Forest in their opening game of the season before being sold to Tottenham Hotspur, scoring a further 21 goals for the North London side in the league. PFA Player of the Year was Paul McGrath of Aston Villa. FWA Player of the Year was Chris Waddle, who helped Sheffield Wednesday achieve runners-up spot in both of the cups after ending his three-year spell in France. PFA Young Player of the Year was Ryan Giggs, who won the award for the second year running, and also picked up a league title medal with Manchester United.\n",
      "Twenty-two teams competed in the league – the top nineteen teams from the First Division and the three teams promoted from the Second Division. The promoted teams were Ipswich Town, Middlesbrough and Blackburn Rovers, returning to the top flight after an absence of six, three and twenty-six years respectively. They replaced Luton Town, Notts County and West Ham United, ending Luton Town's ten-year spell in the top flight, whilst both Notts County and West Ham United were relegated after only one year in the top flight.\n",
      "(as of 9 May 1993)\n",
      "The top goalscorer in the Premier League's inaugural season was Teddy Sheringham, who scored one goal for Nottingham Forest before his early-season transfer followed by 21 for Tottenham Hotspur for a total of 22.[15] Alan Shearer had scored 16 goals by Christmas before suffering a season-ending injury.\n",
      "The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) presented its annual Players' Player of the Year award to Paul McGrath, a veteran central defender who contributed to Aston Villa's second-place finish in the Premier League. Manchester United's Paul Ince came second and Blackburn's Alan Shearer third.[32] The Young Player of the Year award was given to Ryan Giggs, the 19-year-old Manchester United left winger who had also won the award in the previous season. Giggs, who finished ahead of Tottenham's Nick Barmby and Nottingham Forest's Roy Keane, became the first player to win the award more than once.[32]\n",
      "The Football Writers' Association (the FWA) chose Chris Waddle as its Footballer of the Year.[33] Waddle, who made his return to English football with Sheffield Wednesday after three years in France with Olympique Marseille, became the first Wednesday player to win the award in its 45-year history. McGrath and Giggs finished in second and joint third place respectively in the writers' poll.[34]\n",
      "The PFA also selected eleven players to form its Team of the Year. The team included four Manchester United players (Giggs, Ince, Peter Schmeichel and Gary Pallister) and two from Leeds United (Tony Dorigo and Gary Speed). The other members of the team were McGrath, Keane, Shearer, David Bardsley (Queens Park Rangers) and Ian Wright (Arsenal).[32] The Manager of the Year award, chosen by a panel representing football's governing body, the media, and fans, was given to Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson.[35] The newly formed League Managers Association also presented its own Manager of the Year award for the first time, specifically designed to recognise \"the manager who made best use of the resources available to him\". This award went to Dave Bassett of Sheffield United.[35]\n",
      "1993–94 FA Premier League\n",
      "The 1993–94 FA Premier League (known as the FA Carling Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the second season of the Premier League, the top division of professional football in England. Manchester United won the league by eight points over nearest challengers Blackburn Rovers, their second consecutive league title. Swindon Town finished bottom of the league in their first season of top-flight football and were relegated along with Sheffield United and Oldham Athletic. Manchester United also broke their own record of the most points in a season, set by themselves the previous season. This would be surpassed by Chelsea in the 2004–05 season.\n",
      "From the start of the 1993–94 season, the FA Premier League was sponsored by Carling Breweries.\n",
      "Just before the start of the season, Roy Keane became the most expensive footballer signed by an English football team. The 22-year-old Irish midfielder left relegated Nottingham Forest for Manchester United for a fee of £3.75 million.\n",
      "During the 1993–94 season, many players were transferred between Premier League clubs for fees exceeding £1 million. They included David White (Manchester City to Leeds United), David Rocastle (Leeds United to Manchester City), Roy Wegerle (Blackburn Rovers to Coventry City) and Tim Flowers (Southampton to Blackburn Rovers). At £2.5 million, Flowers became the most expensive goalkeeper in English football.\n",
      "Manchester United led the 1993–94 Premier League for almost all of the season, eventually finishing as champions eight points ahead of runners-up Blackburn Rovers. They also won the FA Cup after beating Chelsea 4–0 in the final, thereby becoming only the fourth team to achieve this feat in the 20th century (after Tottenham in 1961, Arsenal in 1971 and Liverpool in 1986). Their lead of the Premier League stood at 11 points by the end of October and peaked at 16 points two months later, but a run of bad results in March was followed by defeat at Blackburn at the beginning of April, which meant that they now led the league merely on goal difference. A return to form then saw United seal the league title with two games still to play.\n",
      "Norwich City, Leeds United, Newcastle United, Everton and Aston Villa were among the sides who showed promise early in the season before Manchester United established a runaway lead. Norwich reached the third round of the UEFA Cup after famously beating Bayern Munich in the second round, but their league form slumped after manager Mike Walker departed to Everton in January, and the Norfolk side finished 12th. Everton's brief lead of the league in the opening stages of the season was followed by a slump in form, and manager Howard Kendall stepped down at the beginning of December with the Toffees now in the bottom half of the table. They only narrowly avoided relegation on the final day of the season. Aston Villa finished a disappointing 10th in the league, but won the Football League Cup for the fourth time.\n",
      "Finishing runners-up in the Premier League were Blackburn Rovers. In third place came Newcastle United, whose 22-year-old striker Andy Cole was the Premier League's leading scorer with 34 goals in 40 games, with a total of 41 goals in all competitions. In fourth place came Arsenal, who achieved success in European competition with a 1–0 win over Parma in the Cup Winners' Cup final.\n",
      "Swindon Town managed just five league wins all season and were relegated in bottom place having conceded 100 league goals in 42 games. Oldham Athletic, who had avoided relegation on goal difference the previous season, were relegated on the final day of the season after failing to win at Norwich City. The final relegation place went to Sheffield United, who were relegated from the top flight after a 3–2 defeat at Chelsea, with the winning goal coming in injury time (a draw would have been enough to survive, and a loss would have still been enough had Everton not won their final match, 3–2 at home to Wimbledon after coming from 0–2 down).\n",
      "Twenty-two teams competed in the league – the top nineteen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Newcastle United, West Ham United and Swindon Town. Newcastle United and West Ham United returned to the top flight after absences of four and one year respectively, while Swindon Town played in the top flight for the first time. They replaced Crystal Palace, Middlesbrough and Nottingham Forest, ending their top flight spells of four, one and sixteen years respectively.\n",

      "1994–95 FA Premier League\n",
      "The 1994–95 FA Premier League (known as the FA Carling Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the third season of the Premier League, the top division of professional football in England.\n",
      "Just before the start of the season, the English transfer record was broken when Blackburn Rovers paid £5 million for 21-year-old Norwich City striker Chris Sutton. But that record was broken again in January when Manchester United paid £6 million for Newcastle United's Andy Cole, in a deal which also saw £1 million-rated Keith Gillespie move to Newcastle. Other significant transfers before and during the 1994–95 season included: Vinny Samways (Tottenham to Everton, £2 million), David Rocastle (Manchester City to Chelsea, £1.25 million), Jürgen Klinsmann (Monaco to Tottenham Hotspur, £2 million), John Scales (Wimbledon to Liverpool, £3 million) and Paul Kitson (Derby County to Newcastle United, £2.2 million).\n",
      "The title was won by Blackburn Rovers, whose last title success was in 1914, and also was Blackburn's first major trophy in 67 years (the last being 1927–28 FA Cup).[3]\n",
      "Kenny Dalglish's side secured the championship on the last day of the season despite losing 2–1 at his former club Liverpool, as Manchester United could only manage a 1–1 draw at West Ham.[4]\t\n",
      "This meant that Blackburn Rovers qualified for the European Cup for the first time in their history, while Manchester United finished second earning a UEFA Cup place. A single point separated the two sides, who for more than half of the season enjoyed a wide gap in terms of point between themselves and the rest of the league, despite the likes of Nottingham Forest, Liverpool and Newcastle United briefly topping the league during the first three months of the season.\n",
      "Also qualifying for the UEFA Cup were Nottingham Forest (who finished third in their first season back in the Premier League), Liverpool (who finished fourth and won their fifth League Cup in the club's first full season following the appointment of Roy Evans) and fifth placed Leeds United.\n",
      "The number of teams in the league for the following year would be reduced to 20. This was to be achieved by increasing the number of teams facing relegation to four, and reducing the number of teams being promoted from Division 1 to two.\n",
      "In January 1995, Manchester United's 28-year-old French striker Eric Cantona (then holder of the PFA Players' Player of the Year award) assaulted a Crystal Palace fan who racially abused him[5] in his team's 1–1 draw at Selhurst Park. Cantona was banned from football for eight months, fined £20,000 and sentenced to 14 days in prison. The prison sentence was later reduced to 120 hours community service on appeal.\n",
      "Chelsea midfielder Dennis Wise was convicted of criminal damage and assault, relating to a fight with a taxi driver in London. He was given a three-month prison sentence but the conviction and prison sentence were quickly overturned on appeal.\n",
      "Arsenal midfielder Paul Merson admitted in November 1994 that he was an alcoholic and was also addicted to cocaine and gambling. He underwent a three-month drug rehabilitation programme before being allowed to resume his playing career.\n",
      "Crystal Palace striker Chris Armstrong failed a drugs test in February 1995 but admitted that he had done wrong and returned to action after just four weeks undergoing rehabilitation. Armstrong was Palace's leading goalscorer in 1994–95, helping them reach the semi finals of both domestic cup competitions, but was unable to prevent them from being relegated back to the First Division just one season after winning promotion.\n",
      "Arsenal manager George Graham was sacked in February 1995 after nearly nine years in charge, when it was revealed that he had accepted an illegal payment of £425,000 from Norwegian agent Rune Hauge relating to the purchases of Norwegian and Danish players Pål Lydersen and John Jensen three years earlier. Graham was later banned from football for one year by the FA.\n",
      "Twenty-two teams competed in the league – the top nineteen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Crystal Palace, Nottingham Forest (both teams returning to the top flight after a season's absence) and Leicester City (returning after a top flight absence of seven years). This was also Leicester City's first season in the Premier League. They replaced Sheffield United, Oldham Athletic and Swindon Town, ending their top flight spells of four, three and one year respectively. This was the final season with 22 teams as all seasons after this one have 20 teams.\n",

      "The 1995–96 FA Premier League (known as the FA Carling Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the fourth season of the competition, since its formation in 1992. Due to the decision to reduce the number of clubs in the Premier League from 22 to 20, only two clubs were promoted instead of the usual three, Middlesbrough and Bolton Wanderers.[3]\n",
      "Manchester United won the Premier League and qualified for the UEFA Champions League, while Arsenal, Aston Villa, and Newcastle United qualified for the UEFA Cup. Liverpool also qualified for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup as runners-up of the FA Cup which was won by Manchester United.\n",
      "Liverpool and Aston Villa emerged as possible title contenders early in the season, while Middlesbrough's early promise saw them occupy fourth place in late October, but an injury crisis saw their league form slump, and they could only manage a 12th-place finish. Most of the campaign was a two-horse race between Manchester United and Newcastle United. The two sides played on 27 December, with Newcastle 10 points ahead in the league. A 2–0 home win for Manchester United cut the gap to seven points, and two days later they beat Queens Park Rangers 2–1 to reduce the gap to just four points. But a 4–1 defeat at Tottenham on New Year's Day and a 0–0 draw with Aston Villa allowed Newcastle to establish a 12-point lead in January.\n",
      "Manchester United and Newcastle met again in early March, and a goal by Eric Cantona gave Manchester United a 1–0 away win and cut the gap to a single point. With one game left of the season, Manchester United led the Premier League by two points, having taken lead of the league halfway through March and stayed on top ever since. In case of the two clubs being tied for first place, the Premier League made preliminary preparations for a championship play-off match at Wembley.[4] For Newcastle to win their first title since 1927, they had to win against Tottenham and hope that Middlesbrough beat their Mancunian rivals. But the Premier League title went to Old Trafford as Manchester United won 3–0 and Newcastle could only manage a 1–1 draw with Tottenham.\n",
      "Despite the arrival of Dennis Bergkamp, Arsenal never looked like serious title challengers, their best chance of success coming in the League Cup, where they reached the semi-finals, losing on away goals to Aston Villa. However, the North London side still qualified for the UEFA Cup by finishing fifth.\n",
      "Aston Villa won the Coca-Cola sponsored League Cup competition this season, beating Leeds United 3–0 at Wembley.\n",
      "Title holders Blackburn recorded the lowest ever finish by a Premier League title-holder by finishing 7th. This record was matched by Manchester United in 2013–14 and broken by Chelsea in 2015–16 and again by Leicester City in 2016–17.\n",
      "Six days after clinching their third league title in four seasons, Manchester United became the first team to complete a second league championship and FA Cup double when a Cantona goal gave them a 1–0 win over Liverpool in the FA Cup final.[5]\n",
      "The Premier League relegation places went to Bolton, Queens Park Rangers and Manchester City. Bolton had spent a large proportion of their first Premier League season bottom of the table. Manchester City failed to beat Liverpool on the final day of the season, consigning them to the final relegation place on goal difference behind Southampton and Coventry City.\n",
      "Blackburn Rovers, the 1994–95 Premier League champions, finished bottom of their group in the UEFA Champions League.[6] Manchester United were knocked out of the UEFA Cup in the first round, with Liverpool and Leeds United both being knocked out at the second round.[7] Everton were beaten in the second round of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.[8] The only English team still in European competition after Christmas were Nottingham Forest, who reached the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup.[7]\n",

The majority of the season was contested by the reigning champions, Manchester United, along with Newcastle United, Arsenal and Liverpool. The title was eventually won by Manchester United, after Liverpool and Newcastle's failure to win in their penultimate games of the season; at 75 points it is the lowest points total for a Premier League champion and lowest since the 3-1-0 points system was introduced in the 1981–82 season.\n",

Middlesbrough finished in 19th place, but they would have been placed outside the relegation zone without a three-point deduction imposed for unilaterally postponing a December 1996 fixture at Blackburn Rovers, with the Middlesbrough board blaming the decision on the absence of 23 players ill or injured.[2][3] The club consulted the Premier League prior to calling off the fixture and were told to do 'what they thought best'. To protect the integrity of the game, and avoid fielding a team of untried teenagers including three goalkeepers, Middlesbrough called off the match. The Premier League subsequently absolved themselves of all responsibility and deducted the three points. This sanction meant Coventry City, who had been in the top division since 1967, finished in 17th place and avoided relegation. The decision was controversial and later resurfaced in 2006–07 when West Ham escaped a points deduction and subsequently avoided relegation.\n",
      "Another relegation place went to Nottingham Forest, who sacked manager Frank Clark in December. Stuart Pearce took over as temporary player-manager, spending three months in charge and winning the January 1997 Manager of the Month award. In March, Pearce quit as manager to be replaced by Dave Bassett, formerly of Crystal Palace. Also relegated, due to a 1–0 defeat to Wimbledon in their last game of the season, were Sunderland, who were leaving Roker Park after 99 years and relocating to the 42,000-seat Stadium of Light on the banks of the River Wear for the start of the 1997–98 season in Division One.\n",
      "Twenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Sunderland, Derby County (both teams returning to the top flight after a five-year absence) and Leicester City (immediately returning to the top flight after a season's absence). This was also both Sunderland and Derby County's first season in the Premier League. They replaced Manchester City, Queens Park Rangers and Bolton Wanderers, ending their top flight spells of seven, thirteen and one year respectively.\n",

      "1997–98 FA Premier League\n",
      "The 1997–98 FA Premier League (known as the FA Carling Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the sixth season of the FA Premier League. It saw Arsenal lift their first league title since 1991[2] and, in so doing, became only the second team to win 'The Double' for the second time. \n",
      "It was Arsenal's first full season under French manager Arsène Wenger, who became the third manager to win the Premier League. Wenger followed in the footsteps of Alex Ferguson and Kenny Dalglish and, while both Ferguson and Dalglish were Scottish, Wenger was the first manager from outside the British Isles to win a league title in England.\n",
      "At the end of the 1997–98 FA Premier League season, a record total of nine English teams qualified for European competition.\n",
      "Premiership champions Arsenal and runners-up Manchester United qualified for the Champions League, while UEFA Cup places went to Liverpool, Leeds United, Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers. Qualifying for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup were Chelsea (as defending champions) and FA Cup runners-up Newcastle United. Crystal Palace, while finishing bottom, qualified for the Intertoto Cup.[3]\n",
      "The gap between the Premier League and Division One of the Football League was highlighted at the end of 1997–98 when all three newly promoted teams were relegated. Crystal Palace were confined to bottom place in the final table having won just two home games all season. Barnsley's first season in the top division ended in relegation, although they did reach the FA Cup quarter finals and knock out Manchester United in the Fifth Round. Bolton Wanderers went down on goal difference, with 17th place being occupied by Everton: despite preserving top flight football there for the 45th season running, Howard Kendall quit as manager at Goodison Park after his third spell in charge.\n",
      "Another mark of the gap was that the three relegated teams in the previous season took the top three places in the 1997–98 Football League. Had Sunderland not lost the play-off final to Charlton Athletic on penalty shootout, the 20 teams from 1998–99 Premier League would have been exactly the same as those in the 1996–97 Premier League.\n",
      "Twenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Bolton Wanderers (returning to the top flight after a season's absence), Barnsley (playing in the top flight for the first time) and Crystal Palace (playing in the top flight again after a two-year absence). They replaced Sunderland, Middlesbrough and Nottingham Forest, who were relegated after top flight spells of one, two and three years respectively.\n",

      "1998–99 FA Premier League\n",
      "\n",
      "The 1998–99 FA Premier League (known as the FA Carling Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the seventh season of the Premier League, the top division of English football, since its establishment in 1992. Manchester United won a unique treble of the league title, the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League. They secured their fifth league championship in seven seasons after losing just three league games all season.\n",
      "The season was also the 100th season of top flight football in England, not counting years lost to the two World Wars. Of the original clubs in the first Football League season, only Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Derby County and Everton were present for this season. \n",
      "Arsenal failed to retain their title, despite having the same points tally as last season 78 points, but had at one point looked as though they were on the brink of winning the title, after beating fellow rivals Tottenham Hotspur, while Manchester United had drawn against Liverpool, 2–2. However, Manchester United pushed on and took advantage of Arsenal's 1–0 defeat at Leeds United in the penultimate match of the season and despite going 1–0 down against Tottenham on the final day, came back to win 2–1 and clinch the title. Should they have failed to win, Arsenal would have been crowned champions once more.\n",
      "To achieve their success, the Manchester United playing squad had been altered substantially during the close season. A total of more than £28 million had been spent on Dwight Yorke, Jaap Stam and Jesper Blomqvist, while several older players left the club; Gary Pallister returned to Middlesbrough after nine years for £2.5 million, while Brian McClair returned to Motherwell on a free transfer. In December, however, McClair was back in the Premier League as Brian Kidd's assistant at Blackburn Rovers.\n",
      "At the end of 1998–99, the Premiership would have three Champions League places. Manchester United as well as runners-up Arsenal and third placed Chelsea would be playing in the following season's Champions League. There would only be one automatic UEFA Cup place from the league – taken by fourth-placed Leeds United. Fifth-placed West Ham United qualified for the UEFA Cup via the Intertoto Cup after achieving their highest league finish for thirteen years as they continued to make progress under Harry Redknapp, outperforming several \"bigger\" clubs with greater resources. Also qualifying were Newcastle United via the 1998–99 FA Cup final, and Tottenham Hotspur via the League Cup.\n",
      "Bottom of the Premiership in the final table came Nottingham Forest, who suffered their third relegation in seven seasons. One notable low for Forest this season was an 8–1 drubbing at home, by Manchester United. Second from bottom came Blackburn Rovers, who just four seasons earlier had been Premiership champions. The final relegation place went to Charlton Athletic, who went down at the end of their first spell in the top flight for nine seasons. The only newly promoted club to survive was Middlesbrough, who finished in a respectable ninth place.\n",
      "None of the teams relegated from the Premiership the previous season regained their top division status in 1999, although First Division champions Sunderland regained their Premiership place after a two-year exile. The other two relegation places went to long-term absentees from the top division. Playoff winners Watford regained their top division place after an absence of 11 years, but runners-up Bradford had been outside of the top division for 77 years. These two promotion winners surprised the observers more than any other Division One side during 1998–99.\n",
      "Twenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Nottingham Forest, Middlesbrough (both teams sealing an immediate return to the top flight) and Charlton Athletic (playing in the top flight after an eight-year absence). This was also Charlton Athletic's first season in the Premier League. They replaced Bolton Wanderers, Barnsley and Crystal Palace, with all three relegated teams immediately returning to the First Division after a mere season's presence.\n",

      "1999–2000 FA Premier League\n",
      "The 1999–2000 FA Premier League (known as the FA Carling Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the eighth season of the FA Premier League, and Manchester United secured their sixth Premiership title. Like the previous season, they lost only three league games all season. Unlike in 1998–99 season, they won by a comfortable margin – 18 points as opposed to a single point.\n",
      "Their only disappointment of the season came when they lost their defence of the European Cup following a 3–2 defeat against Real Madrid in the quarter finals. Manchester United had withdrawn from the 1999–2000 FA Cup to participate in the FIFA World Club Championship at the request of the FA who wanted Manchester United to compete to support England's bid to host the World Cup. Chelsea would go on to win the last\n",
      "FA Cup held at Wembley Stadium before its redevelopment. The League Cup final was won by Leicester City, for the second time in four seasons. In Europe, Leeds United reached the UEFA Cup semi final and Arsenal were on the losing side to Galatasaray in the UEFA Cup final.\n",
      "Only one newly promoted team suffered relegation: Watford, who finished in last place, and achieved a record Premiership low of just 24 points (a record since broken by Sunderland (twice) and by Derby County, Aston Villa, Huddersfield Town, Norwich City and Sheffield United), despite a decent start to their campaign which saw them beat both Liverpool (at Anfield) and Chelsea. The most successful promoted team was Sunderland, who finished seventh in the final table and spent much of the season pushing for a place in European competition. Bradford City, back in the top division for the first time since 1922, secured their Premiership survival on the last day of the season with a 1–0 win over Liverpool. The result meant that Liverpool lost out on a Champions League place, and Wimbledon were relegated after 14 years of top-division football. Second-from-bottom Sheffield Wednesday were relegated in their penultimate game of the season, having spent 15 of the previous 16 seasons in the top division. Wednesday's season included an 8–0 defeat at Newcastle. Amazingly Coventry City went all season without an away win but still managed to secure 14th place due to an impressive home record which saw them win 12 out of their 19 matches.\n",
      "As well as Premiership champions Manchester United and runners-up Arsenal, third placed Leeds United qualified for the 2000–01 Champions League. UEFA Cup places went to fourth placed Liverpool, F.A Cup winners Chelsea, and League Cup winners Leicester City.\n",
      "Promoted to the Premiership for 2000–01 were First Division champions Charlton Athletic, runners-up Manchester City and playoff winners Ipswich Town. For the first time since the formation of the Premiership, all of the promoted teams had been members of the Premiership before.\n",
      "Twenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Sunderland, Bradford City and Watford, returning after absences of two, seventy-seven and eleven years respectively. This was also both Bradford City and Watford's first season in the Premier League. They replaced Charlton Athletic, Blackburn Rovers and Nottingham Forest. Charlton Athletic and Nottingham Forest were immediately relegated after a season's presence while Blackburn Rovers' seven-year top flight spell came to an end.\n",

      "The 2000–01 FA Premier League (known as the FA Carling Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the ninth FA Premier League season and the third season running which ended with Manchester United as champions and Arsenal as runners-up. Sir Alex Ferguson became the first manager to win three successive English league titles with the same club. Liverpool, meanwhile, managed a unique cup treble – winning the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup. They also finished third in the Premier League and qualified for the Champions League. Nike replaced Mitre as manufacturer of the official Premier League match ball, a contract that has since been extended multiple times, with the most recent renewal made in November 2018 to the end of the 2024–25 season.[2]\n",
      "UEFA Cup places went to Leeds United, Chelsea, Ipswich Town, and Aston Villa, who qualified via the Intertoto Cup. None of the top six clubs in the Premier League had an English manager. The most successful English manager in the 2000–01 Premier League campaign was Peter Reid, whose Sunderland side finished seventh, having spent most of the season challenging for a place in Europe, and briefly occupied second place in the Premier League table.\n",
      "Despite the success achieved by Sir Alex Ferguson and Gérard Houllier, the Manager of the Year Award went to George Burley. The Ipswich Town manager was in charge of a newly promoted side who began the season as relegation favourites and on a limited budget, guided his team to fifth place in the Premier League final table earning a total of 66 points - the highest total in Premier League history for a newly promoted side since the switch to a 20-team format—and a place in the UEFA Cup for the first time in almost 20 years. 2000–01 was perhaps the best season yet for newly promoted teams in the Premier League. Charlton Athletic finished ninth, their highest finish since the 1950s. The only newly promoted team to suffer relegation was Manchester City, who in the space of six seasons had now been relegated three times and promoted twice. Relegated in bottom place were Bradford City, whose return to the top division after almost 80 years was over after just two seasons. The next relegation place went to Coventry City, who were finally relegated after 34 successive seasons of top division football, which had brought numerous relegation battles and league finishes no higher than sixth place.\n",
      "Twenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Charlton Athletic, Manchester City and Ipswich Town, returning after a top flight absence of one, four and five years respectively. They replaced Wimbledon, Sheffield Wednesday and Watford. They were relegated after spending fourteen, nine and one year in the top flight respectively.\n",

      "The 2001–02 FA Premier League (known as the FA Barclaycard Premiership for sponsorship reasons) was the tenth season of the competition. It began with a new sponsor, Barclaycard, and was titled the FA Barclaycard Premiership, replacing the previous sponsor, Carling. The title race turned into a battle among four sides – Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool and Newcastle United.\n",
      "Arsenal clinched the title on 8 May 2002 after a convincing win against Manchester United at Old Trafford, in the penultimate game of the season. This new attacking Arsenal side had won the FA Cup five days before and made history by accomplishing their third double, their second under the reign of Arsène Wenger, who showed his commitment by signing a new four-year deal with Arsenal.\n",
      "The season started on 18 August 2001 and ended on 11 May 2002.\n",
      "At the start of 2002 the title race was wide open, with the likes of Newcastle United and Leeds United contesting at the top of the table along with the usual likes of Arsenal and Manchester United. Newcastle, after back-to-back away wins at Arsenal and Leeds during the Christmas period, confirmed themselves as genuine title challengers and led the league at the turn of the year. Leeds had topped the table at Christmas prior to losing at Elland Road to Newcastle.\n",
      "Despite being top of the table at the start of December – eleven points clear of Manchester United – Liverpool underwent a severe slump, falling to fifth place, five points behind United. Would-be contenders Chelsea, Newcastle United and Leeds United had by this point disappeared into the chasing pack.\n",
      "January saw Liverpool travelling to both Highbury and Old Trafford in the space of a fortnight. Liverpool's Danny Murphy scored a late winner to give the Merseyside club all three points against United, and John Arne Riise then salvaged a point for Liverpool against Arsenal, allowing Manchester United to top the table for the first time that season.\n",
      "In March, Arsenal were installed as strong favourites for the Premiership title after Liverpool's defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. Arsenal's April triumph against Bolton Wanderers brought them to within three points of a second Premier League title under Arsène Wenger.\n",
      "Fittingly, the Premiership title would be decided at Old Trafford as Arsenal and Manchester United faced one another in a decisive encounter. Arsenal only required a draw to guarantee their second title in five seasons to go with their FA Cup victory against London rivals Chelsea four days previously; United had to win to take the title race to the last day. In the end, Arsenal emerged victorious as their record signing Sylvain Wiltord scored the only goal of the game as Arsenal was confirmed Premiership champions with a game to spare. Manchester United's disappointment was compounded by Liverpool leapfrogging them into second place by virtue of their 4–3 victory against Blackburn Rovers.\n",
      "On the final day of the season Liverpool confirmed second place by trashing soon to be relegated Ipswich Town 5–0 at Anfield. Arsenal rounded off their successful league campaign in style, beating Everton 4–3 at Highbury. Manchester United limped to a poor draw against Charlton Athletic, completing a disappointing campaign for the deposed league champions.\n",
      "For the first time in the history of the Premier League, all three promoted teams avoided relegation – Fulham, Bolton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers. Blackburn Rovers and Bolton Wanderers avoided relegation until 2011–12, when the three promoted teams of 2010–11 coincidentally avoided relegation again, whilst Fulham avoided relegation until the 2013–14 season.\n",
      "Fulham had splashed out £34 million on new players during the close season, with their owner Mohamed Al-Fayed being one of the wealthiest benefactors in English football. He even boasted that they would win the Premiership title in 2001–02, and most pundits tipped Fulham, managed by former French international Jean Tigana, to push for a place in Europe. However, Fulham finished thirteenth, 47 points away from Arsenal.\n",
      "Bolton Wanderers went top of the Premiership after winning their first three fixtures of the season, causing an upset by beating Gérard Houllier's Liverpool in the latter stage of the game. Manager Sam Allardyce was boasting that his side were good enough to win their first ever league title, but Bolton's league form slumped after the first two months of the season and they finished 16th place – their survival confirmed in the penultimate game of the season.\n",
      "Blackburn Rovers were the most successful of the promoted sides. Graeme Souness' men beat Tottenham Hotspur 2–1 in the League Cup final to lift the trophy for the first time, and then climbed from 18th place in the Premiership in late February to finish in a secure 10th place – higher than any other newly promoted team that season. Blackburn secured a UEFA Cup place for 2002–03.\n",
      "Leicester City was the first team officially relegated from the Premiership, finishing bottom of table with just five Premiership wins in their last season at 111-year-old Filbert Street before relocation to the new 32 000-seat Walkers Stadium. The club went through the regime of two managers during the season – Peter Taylor was replaced by Dave Bassett in early October; six months later Bassett joined the club's board to be replaced by former assistant manager Micky Adams.\n",
      "Just after the start of the 2002–03 season, Leicester's relegation (which cost them extensive television revenue) and the cost of their new stadium had created debts in excess of £30 million, and the club went into administration before being taken over by a new owner. Despite this setback, Leicester gained promotion back to the Premiership at the first time of asking, although they slipped back down again after just one season and Adams had since resigned to make way for new manager Craig Levein.\n",
      "Next to go down were Derby County, who had been promoted alongside Leicester six years earlier. Manager Jim Smith resigned in early October to be replaced by assistant manager Colin Todd, who was sacked three months later after Derby were knocked out of the FA Cup by Division Three strugglers Bristol Rovers.\n",
      "The last team to be relegated were Ipswich Town, who had qualified for the UEFA Cup and earned manager George Burley the Manager of the Year award the previous season after finishing fifth. Ipswich made a terrible start to the season, winning just one of their first 18 Premiership games. They then went on a strong run of form, winning seven out of eight games, which looked to have secured their Premiership survival, but they then suffered another setback which George Burley's men were unable to reverse, and their relegation was confirmed on the final day of the season by a 5–0 thrashing at Liverpool.\n",
      "Twenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Fulham, Blackburn Rovers and Bolton Wanderers, returning after a top flight absence of thirty-three, two and three years respectively. This was also Fulham's first season in the Premier League.

      "Manchester United ended the campaign as champions for the eighth time in eleven years – an achievement made all the more remarkable by the fact that defending champions Arsenal had been in the lead by eight points on 2 March. After defeating Birmingham at the start of the season, Arsenal equalled a top-flight record of fourteen straight wins but failed to extend it in their next game at West Ham United, being held to a 2–2 draw. They remained unbeaten for 30 Premier League games, 23 of which were played away, until late October, and scored in a record 55 consecutive league games, beating the previous record of 47 set by Chesterfield during the 1930-31 Third Division North season. This run ended at Old Trafford on 7 December 2002, when Manchester United won 2–0.[2] Arsenal then threw away a priceless lead against Bolton Wanderers and finally surrendered the title with a 3–2 home defeat to Leeds United in their antepenultimate game of the season, a result that also saved Leeds from relegation. Newcastle United and Chelsea were the remaining Champions League qualifiers, at the expense of Liverpool who had to settle for the UEFA Cup; they would be joined in Europe by Blackburn Rovers for a second successive season, along with Southampton who were back in Europe for the first time since 1984.\n",
      "At the bottom end of the table, West Ham United, West Bromwich Albion and Sunderland were relegated to the Football League First Division; West Ham's 42 points from a 38-game season was a record for a relegated team. Promoted to replace them were 2002–03 Football League First Division champions Portsmouth, runners-up Leicester City, and play-off winner Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n",
      "Twenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the First Division. The promoted teams were Manchester City (immediately returning after a season's absence), West Bromwich Albion, and Birmingham City (both teams returning to the top flight after a sixteen-year absence). This was also both West Bromwich Albion and Birmingham City's first season in the Premier League.

      "The Premier League Manager of the Year award was won by Sir Alex Ferguson[33] for winning his eighth title and regaining the league after a superb second half to the season, involving an 18-match unbeaten run.\n",
      "The Premier League Player of the Year award was given to Ruud van Nistelrooy,[34] whose form, creativity and goals all helped Manchester United regain the league from Arsenal.\n",
      "The Premier League Golden Boot award was also won by Ruud van Nistelrooy who scored 25 goals in 38 league matches and 44 in all competitions. He also equalled his record of eight goals in eight successive matches at the beginning of the season, a milestone he had reached the previous season. Van Nistelrooy finished one goal ahead of Arsenal's Thierry Henry while James Beattie managed 23 league goals for Southampton.\n",
      "The Premier League Golden Gloves award was given to Chelsea goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini, who proved vital in their quest for UEFA Champions League football. He kept twelve clean sheets – the most in the season – and only conceded 35 goals. Viewers of ITV's On the Ball voted Cudicini, ahead of Southampton keeper Antti Niemi, and Blackburn Rovers' Brad Friedel.[35]\n",
      "The annual award was won by a wonder goal from Thierry Henry against Tottenham Hotspur, on 16 November 2002, voted by viewers of ITV's The Premiership.\n",
      "Henry – chance for a break out, Wiltord to his right, Bergkamp to his left...they'll do well to catch up with Thierry Henry though...he's drifted away from Carr – HENRY! What a fabulous solo goal by Thierry Henry. A long distance goal followed by a long distance celebration...and Arsenal are back in the goalscoring business, after their midweek blank. Henry's been short of a goal or two just recently...but look at the confidence as he breaks from inside his own half, shrugging off Etherington, stepping away from Carr and from King...and picking his spot – he had options...but he had eyes for only one thing – the back of Kasey Keller's net. Thierry Henry moves into double figures for the season.The French striker picked up the ball from his side of the pitch and ran almost 30 yards (27 m), twisting and turning the Spurs defence to unleash a thunderous shot. In celebration, he ran the distance of the whole pitch and skidded in front of the Spurs faithful. The goal proved important as it helped them regain their position at the top of the Premiership from Liverpool.\n",

      "Having qualified for the Champions League the previous season, Chelsea were bolstered by a £100 million outlay on world-class players, a spree funded by the extensive financial resources of their new owner Roman Abramovich. Manchester United's attack was as strong as ever thanks to free-scoring Ruud van Nistelrooy, but the midfield was weakened following the £25 million pre-season sale of David Beckham to Real Madrid, and the centre of defence suffered a more severe setback after Rio Ferdinand was ruled out for the final four months of the season after being found guilty of the \"failure or refusal to take a drugs test\". The case of Rio Ferdinand started a debate about punishments relating to drug testing in football, with there being differing views on whether the punishment was too harsh or too lenient. Ferdinand's club sought to make direct comparisons with an earlier case of Manchester City reserve player who had in fact committed a lesser drug testing offence and as a result escaped with only a fine.[2] City themselves had just moved from Maine Road to the City of Manchester Stadium.[3]\n",
      "Arsenal, meanwhile, had only signed German goalkeeper Jens Lehmann in the 2003 close season, but French striker Thierry Henry was instrumental in Arsenal's success. Away from the Premier League, Arsène Wenger's team suffered disappointment in the cup competitions. They were knocked-out by League Cup eventual winners Middlesbrough in the semi-finals. They lost their grip on the FA Cup (which they held for two seasons in a row) after being defeated by eventual winners Manchester United in the semi-final. Arsenal were knocked out of the Champions League quarter-finals by Chelsea (3–2 on aggregate). These blows in the FA Cup and Champions League came within a few days of each other, and it was feared[who?] that Arsenal might squander their lead of the Premier League for the second successive season, but Arsenal easily defeated Liverpool only days later. \n",
      "The 2003/04 Premier League season saw Arsène Wenger lead the North-London club to a first undefeated season, solidifying his managerial legacy and longevity to the Arsenal fanbase as they finished the season with 26 wins, 12 draws, 0 defeats and 90 points; the tied-tenth highest points tally ever seen in a premier league season, winning with an 11-point margin to Claudio Ranieri's Chelsea. Thierry Henry proved decisive in the critical moments, inspiring comebacks against close rivals Liverpool and Chelsea, including a hat-trick to seal a 4-2 win from being 2-1 down initially.\n",
      "The relegation spots were occupied by three teams bracketed together on 33 points. Wolves and Leicester City followed the trend of many other newly promoted Premier League clubs and were relegated just one season after reaching the top division. For Leicester City, they would not return to the top flight for another 10 years and became the league champions for the first time ever in their history just a season later, whilst Wolves had been promoted back to the top flight in 2009-10 Premier League and slipped down again 3 years later. The other relegation place went to Leeds United, whose playing fortunes had dipped in the past two seasons after David O'Leary was sacked as manager and club debts had risen so high that many star players had to be sold. As a result, Leeds were relegated from the Premier League after 14 years of top division football – just three seasons after they had reached the Champions League semifinals, and they would not return for another 16 years.\n",
      "In his third season as Middlesbrough manager, Steve McClaren had guided the Teessiders to their first ever major trophy – sealed with a 2–1 win over Bolton Wanderers in the League Cup final. McClaren was also the first English manager to win a major trophy since Brian Little guided Aston Villa to League Cup success in 1996.

Arsenal were the defending champions after going unbeaten the previous season. Chelsea won the title with a then record 95 points, which was previously set by Manchester United in the 1993–94 season, and later surpassed by Manchester City in the 2017–18 season (100), securing the title with a 2–0 win at the Reebok Stadium against Bolton Wanderers. Chelsea also broke a number of other records during their campaign, most notably breaking the record of most games won in a single Premier League campaign, securing 29 wins in the league in home and away matches, which was later surpassed by themselves in the 2016–17 season.\n",
      "Arsenal were the favourites to defend their title after finishing the previous season unbeaten, but they also faced competition in the form of regular challengers Manchester United and Chelsea, the latter under the new management of Portuguese José Mourinho, who had just won the UEFA Champions League with Porto. Liverpool also had a new manager in Spaniard Rafael Benítez, who had just won La Liga and the UEFA Cup with Valencia and were expected to challenge for the title too. Another managerial change at a club aiming for the top was at Tottenham Hotspur, who appointed Jacques Santini, who had just led France to the quarter-finals of the 2004 European Championship.\n",
      "At the other end of the table, amongst those tipped for relegation were Norwich City, Crystal Palace and West Bromwich Albion, having all just been promoted from the First Division (which was rebranded this season as the Championship). Everton, Manchester City, Blackburn Rovers and Portsmouth were also tipped to struggle, the first three finishing just outside the relegation places the previous season and Portsmouth being in their second season.\n",
      "Arsenal's record-breaking unbeaten streak of 49 games was ended on 24 October 2004, when Manchester United beat them 2–0 at Old Trafford.\n",
      "For the first time since the advent of the Premier League in 1992, no team was mathematically relegated before the final day of the season. In each of the last three weekends of the season, the team that was bottom of the table at the start of the weekend finished it outside the drop zone. The final round of the season started on 15 May with West Bromwich Albion at the bottom, Southampton and Crystal Palace one point ahead and Norwich City a further point ahead, in the last safe spot.\n",
      "West Brom, who had been bottom of the table and eight points from safety on Christmas Day, did their part by defeating Portsmouth at home 2–0. Norwich, the only side to have their fate completely in their own hands, lost 6–0 at Fulham and went down. Southampton lost 2–1 at home to Manchester United and were relegated after 27 years in the top flight and did not return to the top flight for 7 years. Palace, away to Charlton Athletic, were leading 2–1 after 71 minutes, but with eight minutes to go, Charlton's Jonathan Fortune equalised to relegate Palace, who did not return for 8 years, where they finally avoided relegation for the first time in the Premier League era. Thus, West Brom stayed up, becoming the first club in Premier League history to avoid relegation after being bottom of the table at Christmas.\n",
      "At the end of the 90 minutes in all four matches, cameras focused on West Brom's home ground, The Hawthorns, as confirmation of other results began to filter through.

The season saw Chelsea retain their title after defeating Manchester United 3–0 at Stamford Bridge towards the end of April. On the same day, West Bromwich Albion and Birmingham City were relegated, joining Sunderland in the Championship for the following season. Chelsea drew the record they set  the previous season, with 29 wins in home and away campaigns.[citation needed]\n",
      "Several clubs reported disappointing attendances and/or trouble selling out their grounds for the opening weeks' matches. Many have argued that this was due mainly to the comparatively early season start and the Ashes Test cricket series which caught the nation's imagination and which England went on to win. Other possible reasons are continued escalation of ticket prices and the increasing number of games shown on television (which has had the knock on effect of greater variation in kick-off times). The overall decline in attendances for the season was only around 2%, but that figure is reduced by the fact that bigger clubs were promoted into the Premiership than were relegated and several clubs have suffered larger falls.[citation needed]\n",
      "For the second time in two seasons, José Mourinho's Chelsea triumphed in the Premier League, with a home win over closest rivals Manchester United confirming them as champions after a record setting albeit tense season.[citation needed]\n",
      "Chelsea's early season form with 14 wins out of 16 gave the champions an unequivocal head start. With Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool falling way short of their expectations before Christmas, Chelsea had effectively become champions-elect by early 2006. However, a sudden collapse in form by mid-March caused their seemingly unassailable lead of 16 points to be cut to just 7 in two months due to the impressive late run of form of Manchester United, who went on a nine-match winning streak scoring over 20 goals. However, a shock home draw with bottom of the table Sunderland at Old Trafford killed United's title hopes. The momentum was back with Chelsea who didn't need a second bite at the apple with wins over Bolton, Everton and finally Manchester United giving the west Londoners their second successive championship under Mourinho.[citation needed]\n",
      "The top two clubs at the end of the season earned the right to participate in the UEFA Champions League group stages, while the third- and fourth-placed clubs get places in the Champions League Third Qualifying Round (where they progress to the Champions League group stages if they win or the UEFA Cup if they lose). However, if an English team wins the Champions League, but finishes outside the top four, then they get the final Champions League spot instead of the fourth-placed club, who have to settle for a place in the UEFA Cup. This could have been the case with Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, but Arsenal pipped Spurs to fourth place in the final matchday of the season before losing 2–1 to FC Barcelona in the final of the UEFA Champions League.[citation needed]\n",
      "The fifth-placed club always earns a spot in the UEFA Cup. The winners of the FA Cup also earn a place in the UEFA Cup. If they have already qualified for European competition by their league position or winning the League Cup, then the FA Cup runners-up get their place. If the runners-up, too, have already qualified, then the highest league finisher who have not already qualified for Europe (normally sixth place) are given the place. This season, the FA Cup final featured Liverpool and West Ham. Since Liverpool finished third they were assured of a spot in the Champions League qualifying round, which in turn meant that West Ham received the cup winner's UEFA Cup place.[citation needed]\n",
      "The League Cup winners also qualify for the UEFA Cup. If they have already qualified for European competition through other means then their place is, unlike the FA Cup, not awarded to the runner-up, but instead the highest league finisher who has not qualified for Europe. League Cup winners Manchester United finished second, placing them directly into the Champions League group stage. This meant that the sixth-placed club, Blackburn Rovers, qualified for the UEFA Cup. The team directly after the UEFA Cup places, goes into the UEFA Intertoto Cup which means in turn, if the team – Newcastle United this season – wins a 2-legged match means they earn a place in the qualifying round of the UEFA Cup.[citation needed]\n",

Additionally, a fan who correctly predicted that Volz would score the historic goal in a contest presented the player with a special award prior to Fulham's game against Watford at Craven Cottage on 1 January.[15] The honour of scoring the 15,000th goal led to Volz being nicknamed \"15,000 Volz\".[citation needed]\n",

It meant that Hull City and Sunderland stayed up despite home defeats to Manchester United and Chelsea respectively. The fact that Hull City avoided relegation (along with Stoke City, who stayed up relatively comfortably under the management of Tony Pulis), meant it was the first time since the 2005–06 season that more than one promoted club maintained their Premier League status.

The title was City's first Premier League success, making them the fifth club to win the Premier League in its 20-year history.[3] City finished level on 89 points with Manchester United, but their goal difference was eight better than their local rivals', making it the only time the Premier League had been won on goal difference.\n",

City's local rivals Manchester United were the early pace-setters, leading the table until October when they drew at Liverpool allowing Manchester City to overtake them. The following week, City increased their lead to five points with a shock 6–1 away victory at Old Trafford, which they maintained until December, when they dropped points and their lead narrowed, but City remained in front until March, when a defeat at Swansea City saw them drop behind United. City's bad form continued for the next month while United went on a winning run, so that with six matches remaining United were eight points ahead of City and the title seemingly decided. However, United then faltered with a defeat and a draw in their next three games, while City won all three to narrow the gap to three points. City then beat United 1–0 at the City of Manchester Stadium to move back ahead of United on goal difference. Both sides won their penultimate matches to maintain the status quo.\n",
      "Going into the final matches, which were played simultaneously, City were top of the league, ahead of Manchester United on goal difference. However, a Wayne Rooney goal away to Sunderland gave United the advantage. A 39th-minute goal from Pablo Zabaleta, his first of the season, put City back on top at half time. In a dramatic second half Djibril Cissé equalised for Queens Park Rangers in the 48th minute. Shortly after, Joey Barton of QPR was sent off for elbowing Carlos Tevez; on his way off the pitch, he kicked Sergio Agüero, attempted to headbutt Vincent Kompany and squared up to Mario Balotelli. Despite the numerical advantage, City went behind after Jamie Mackie gave QPR the lead in the 66th minute. As time wound down in both matches, it appeared that Manchester United would win the title with their victory over Sunderland. But Edin Džeko equalised for City in the 92nd minute. While United players waited on the field at Sunderland for a possible trophy presentation, Manchester City's Sergio Agüero scored the game winner in the 94th minute to clinch the title on goal difference.[5][6] The 6–1 loss was even more important than it seemed at the time, because if City had won by a single goal then both teams would have ended with identical records (points, goal difference, goals scored, win record, etc.) which by Premier League rules would have meant a play-off game at a neutral ground to decide the title.[7]\n",
      "For most of the season, Tottenham Hotspur were in third place, a couple of points behind the Manchester clubs, and there was much speculation as to whether Tottenham could mount a title challenge. However, from late February onward their season collapsed, starting with a 5–2 defeat to local rivals Arsenal, whom they had been 10 points ahead of before the game, and just four wins in their last 13 games condemned Tottenham to finishing a point below Arsenal, who finished third to join Manchester City and Manchester United in the UEFA Champions League,[8] Arsenal completed a strong recovery from a disastrous start to the season including their 8–2 defeat at Manchester United in August. Tottenham finished in the fourth and final Champions League slot but missed out on qualification for the competition because Chelsea's victory in the 2012 Champions League Final automatically entitled them to defend their title in the 2012–13 tournament at the expense of the lowest ranked team that would otherwise qualify for the competition through league position. This was the first time that this rule had been implemented in the Premier League, having been introduced by UEFA after Liverpool's controversial qualification for the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League. This consequently marked the first time that the club finishing fourth in the Premier League had not qualified for the tournament since the fourth qualifying spot was introduced in the 2001–02 season. Newcastle United finished fifth and qualified for the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League.[9] Everton finished 7th, just above local rivals Liverpool. Despite finishing above them for the first time in seven years, it was Liverpool who claimed the final Europa League slot, by virtue of winning the 2011–12 Football League Cup.[10]\n",

Defending champions Manchester City opened their season with a narrow 3–2 victory over Southampton, who had just been promoted back to the Premier League after seven seasons in lower divisions. Man City had taken a 1–0 lead, with Southampton turning it on its head to go 2–1 up with 20 minutes remaining. City eventually came back and Samir Nasri scored the winning goal with ten minutes left.[9] In a Monday evening fixture at Goodison Park, Manchester United started their season with a 1–0 loss to Everton, the goal scored by Marouane Fellaini.[10] The first goal of the season, however, was scored by Swansea City's Michu,[11] whose team thrashed Queens Park Rangers 5–0 away from home.[12]\n",

The game was a highly anticipated rematch between the two teams that squared off on the final day of the 2011–12 season, when Manchester City snatched the title on goal difference with a late goal by Sergio Agüero. This time though, it was less exciting, with Manchester City comfortably winning 3–1.[16] Level on points with Manchester City in second place were Swansea City, who registered a 2–2 draw with Sunderland, and West Bromwich Albion, who defeated Everton 2–0.[17]\n",
      "The fourth week of the season began with controversy, as the Chelsea v Queens Park Rangers match was fraught with racial tensions when QPR's Anton Ferdinand refused to shake hands with Chelsea's John Terry, who had been suspended for four games for using racial epithets against Ferdinand during the previous season.[18] The teams would play out a 0–0 draw, however second place Manchester City could not gain ground as they also drew, with Stoke City.[19]\n",
      "Week five saw Chelsea extend their league lead to 3 points with a 1–0 win over Stoke City. A late goal in the 85th minute by Ashley Cole secured the win for the Blues.[20] Everton and West Bromwich Albion maintained control of second place, with both teams notching a win in week five, though a draw by the Baggies in week six would drop them back to fifth place, which they would share with Tottenham Hotspur following their surprise 3–2 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford. Chelsea, Everton, and Manchester City would all win in week six. The results table after six games would have Chelsea in the lead with 16 points, followed by Everton and Manchester City with 13 points each, and Manchester United with 12. At the bottom of the league, Liverpool forward Luis Suárez scored a hat trick against Norwich City, leading Liverpool to a 5–2 victory. It was the second consecutive year that Suárez had scored a hat trick at Carrow Road.[21]\n",
      "The month of October saw a tightening at the top of the standings, with Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City all winning their first two of three games for the month, setting up a vital Sunday afternoon match at Stamford Bridge between third placed Manchester United and the leaders Chelsea. The game did not disappoint, as Chelsea went down 2–0 early on an own goal by David Luiz in the fourth minute and a goal by Robin van Persie in the 12th. Van Persie had also taken the shot that had rebounded off of Luiz, and thus was ultimately responsible for the Red Devil's one-goal lead at half-time, following a late first half goal by Chelsea's Juan Mata from a free kick. Eight minutes into the second half Ramires equalised for Chelsea, and in the 75th minute United's Javier Hernández scored what proved to be the deciding goal via a rebound from a missed Van Persie shot. Replays showed that Hernández was in an offside position, generating a great deal of controversy. After the game, only a single point separated leaders Chelsea from second placed Manchester United.[22] The rest of the standings were tightly packed in mid-table as 4 points separated fourth through ninth place. Another key match in October included a fixture between Liverpool and Reading, with Liverpool winning 1–0 (with winger Raheem Sterling scoring his first goal for the club) and giving manager Brendan Rodgers his first win at Anfield in the league against Reading, a team he formerly managed.[23] The final week of October featured the longest match in the 20-year history of the Premier League, a 103-minute game between Manchester City and Swansea that featured two serious injuries, one to the groin of Swansea keeper Michel Vorm and the other to the knee of Manchester City back Micah Richards, both of which required stretchers to carry them off. City prevailed 1–0 in the marathon event with a goal from Carlos Tevez.[24][25]\n",
      "League leaders Chelsea suffered a dip in form in November. They opened the month with draws against Swansea City and Liverpool, dropping them to third in the standings. A loss to West Bromwich Albion on 17 November was marked by ineffective second half play, as the team was unable to capitalise on a late first half equaliser by Eden Hazard.[26] The Blues closed out the month with uninspiring 0–0 draws against Manchester City and Fulham. The primary beneficiaries of Chelsea's slide were Manchester United and Manchester City, as the two rivals moved into commanding control of the first two places in the league table. Key November games included a 2–1 Manchester United win over Arsenal on 3 November,[27] and a dominating 5–0 win by Manchester City over Aston Villa on 17 November marked by a pair of two-goal performances by Carlos Tevez and Sergio Aguero.[28] West Bromwich Albion proved to be the biggest mover up the league table, moving from eighth up to joint third with Chelsea, on the strength of four wins over Southampton, Wigan Athletic, Chelsea, and Sunderland. At the bottom end of the table, Queens Park Rangers found themselves as the only team without a league win by the end of November.\n",
      "The month of December saw minimal change in the standings at the top end of the table. The situation by New Year's Eve with the top three places was the same as it was at the start of the month, though Manchester United had extended their lead over second place Manchester City to seven points, with Chelsea four points back from City in third place. Tottenham Hotspur occupied fourth place with Arsenal, Everton, and West Bromwich Albion all tied for fifth. Chelsea stopped their November slide with a 3–1 win at Sunderland on 8 December on the strength of two goals by Fernando Torres.[29] The Manchester derby was renewed on 9 December at the City of Manchester Stadium with first place on the line. United took a two-goal lead thanks to two goals from Wayne Rooney in the 16th and 30th minute. City responded with a Yaya Touré goal in the 60th minute, a goal that followed two saves in rapid succession by United keeper David de Gea. Pablo Zabaleta equalised in the 86th minute, but Robin van Persie once again proved to be the hero for United, scoring the winning goal two minutes into injury time to extend United's lead over City at the top of the table to six points.[30] The last team without a league win, Queens Park Rangers, finally got their first win of the season on 15 December.\n",
      "Twenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams were Reading, Southampton and West Ham United, returning to the top flight after absences of four, seven and one year respectively. They replaced Bolton Wanderers, Blackburn Rovers (both teams relegated after eleven years in the top flight) and Wolverhampton Wanderers (ending their three-year top flight spell).\n",

      "The 2015–16 Premier League (known as the Barclays Premier League for sponsorship reasons) was the 24th season of the Premier League, the top English professional league for association football clubs, since its establishment in 1992, and the 117th season of top-flight English football overall. The season began on 8 August 2015, and was scheduled to conclude on 15 May 2016.[6] However, the match between Manchester United and Bournemouth on the final day was postponed to 17 May 2016 due to a suspicious package found at Old Trafford.[7]\n",
      "Chelsea began the season as defending champions of the 2014–15 season. Bournemouth, Watford and Norwich City entered as the three promoted teams from the 2014–15 Football League Championship.\n",
      "Leicester City, managed by Italian Claudio Ranieri, won the championship for the first time in their 132-year history, with 2 games to spare, after Tottenham failed to beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 2 May 2016, becoming the 24th club to become English football champions, and the sixth club to win the Premier League. Many commentators consider this to be one of the greatest sporting shocks in history, especially given that Leicester spent a great deal of the previous season at the bottom of the table before rallying towards the season's end to finish 14th. Bookmakers gave the Foxes 5000/1 odds of winning the league at the beginning of the season.\n",
      "Leicester striker Jamie Vardy's goal against Manchester United on 28 November 2015 meant he had scored in 11 consecutive matches, surpassing Ruud van Nistelrooy's Premier League record of 10 straight games with a goal, which he set in 2003.[8]\n",
      "Aston Villa, one of seven teams who had played in the Premier League since its inaugural season, were relegated from the top flight in England for the first time since 1987.\n",
      "Leicester celebrated their title win with renditions of \"Nessun dorma\" and \"Con te partirò\" by Andrea Bocelli, who sang for the Leicester fans on the pitch of the King Power Stadium in May.\n",
      "Leicester City were the surprise of the season. Following their late escape from relegation in the previous season many pundits had predicted that they would be relegated[9] and bookmakers gave 5,000–1 odds on them winning the title.[10] After the dismissal of manager Nigel Pearson, they began the new season with Italian Claudio Ranieri in charge. Pearson had been known for his short temper with the press, while Ranieri has a reputation for good humour.[11] The appointment was met with scepticism by pundits, including Leicester fan and former player Gary Lineker, as Ranieri had recently been sacked from his previous post as manager of the Greece national team after suffering a humiliating defeat to the Faroe Islands in his last game in charge.[11][12]\n",
      "Despite winning their opening game against Sunderland and topping the table, they dropped back following a 5–2 home defeat to Arsenal in September.[13] However, aided by Jamie Vardy's record feat of scoring in eleven consecutive Premier League games,[1] they then remained unbeaten – and returned to the top of the table – until 26 December, when a 1–0 defeat to Liverpool dropped them to second place. They returned to the top after a 1–1 draw with Aston Villa on 16 January, and remained there for the rest of the season.[13] Following a 2–2 draw between Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur at Stamford Bridge on 2 May 2016, and having two more games to play, Leicester City were confirmed champions, their first title in the top flight of English football, eclipsing the runners-up spot they reached in 1929.[10]\n",
      "Defending champions Chelsea sacked manager José Mourinho in December while in 16th place and eventually failed to qualify for European football for the first time in two decades. Eden Hazard, the previous season's PFA Players' Player of the Year, did not score a league goal until late April.[14] They eventually finished 10th, breaking the record for lowest finish for a Premier League title holder - 7th - held jointly by Blackburn Rovers in 1995–96 and Manchester United in 2013–14.[15] This record only stood for one year, as Leicester City finished 12th the following season.\n",
      "Arsenal, looking for their first title since 2004 and following a poor start, improved and in early January took the top spot from Leicester. However, a poor run of results, including draws with Liverpool,[16] Stoke City[17] and Southampton,[18] and a loss to Chelsea[19] saw them drop to fourth by mid-February. They remained in contention, but draws with West Ham United, Sunderland and Crystal Palace in April saw their title hopes vanish.[20][21][22]\n",
      "Meanwhile, Arsenal's London rivals Tottenham Hotspur won six matches in a row, and when Arsenal lost to Manchester United at the end of February, Tottenham leapfrogged them into second place,[23] where they remained until the final weekend of the season. Draws with West Bromwich Albion[24] and Chelsea prevented them from winning their first league title since 1961. The game in which Tottenham's title challenge ended was their 2–2 draw at Chelsea on 2 May, with many altercations between players and benches on and off the field, especially after Eden Hazard scored the equalizing and final goal.[25] Mark Clattenburg, who refereed the game, subsequently stated that he could have \"sent three players off from Tottenham\" but chose instead to allow them to play on, giving the team a total of nine yellow cards (a league record), so as to allow them to \"self destruct\" and have no one else to blame but themselves.[26][27]\n",
      "After a 2–1 home loss to Southampton and a 5–1 defeat away to Newcastle United in their final two matches, Tottenham ended the season in third place, one point behind Arsenal.[28]\n",
      "West Ham United, in their final season at the Boleyn Ground after 112 years, achieved 62 points, a club record for a Premier League campaign. It was also the first Premier League season where they had finished with a positive goal difference (+14) and West Ham's eight defeats was also a club record for the fewest losses suffered in a Premier League season. \n",
      "Aston Villa, a presence in the Premier League since the league's foundation in 1992 and present in the top division since the 1988–89 season, were the first team to be mathematically relegated, after a 1–0 loss at Manchester United on 16 April.[29] On 11 May, Sunderland won 3–0 against Everton, a result which relegated both Newcastle United and Norwich City with one game remaining.[30]\n",
      "All of the final fixtures of the season were scheduled for 15 May and were to kick off at the same time. However, Manchester United's home game against Bournemouth was postponed to two days later after Old Trafford was evacuated because of the discovery of a suspicious device, which was destroyed in a controlled explosion. It was confirmed to be an accidental leftover from a training exercise.[31]\n",
      "The unlikely nature of Leicester's title led to a flood of coverage from across the globe. Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted his congratulations, saying it was \"An extraordinary, thoroughly deserved, Premier League title.\" Congratulations were also sent by the Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who praised his compatriot Ranieri.[32]\n",
      "Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore described it as \"biggest story we've ever had\" in English football.[33] Former Leicester manager Martin O'Neill described it as the \"greatest achievement of this century\".[33] Gary Lineker, the former Leicester striker who led a consortium that saved the club from administration in 2002, had said he would host the BBC football show Match of the Day in his underwear if Leicester won the title. After they won the title, he did indeed present the show clad only in boxer shorts.[34] He said: \"There were no odds that I would have taken at the start of the season. No odds. You could have given me 10 million to one and I'd have said 'Nah, it's a waste of a quid'\".[35] José Mourinho, manager of 2015 champions Chelsea and Ranieri's replacement at the same team eleven years earlier, sent his congratulations, saying: \"I lost my title to Claudio Ranieri and it is with incredible emotion that I live this magic moment in his career.\"[36]\n",
      "Ranieri said after winning his first title at the age of 64 that he wouldn't have appreciated it as a young man: \"Now I am an old man I can feel it much better.\"[36][37]\n",
      "The long odds bookmakers had given Leicester at the start of the season led to them incurring losses of up to £25 million, with one punter winning over £100,000, having wagered £20 at the original 5,000–1 odds;[38] the largest payout was £200,000 to an anonymous bettor who wagered £100 on the team in October when the odds were improved to 2,000–1.[39]\n",

When including the Football League era, it was the worst title defence since 1991–92 champions Leeds United finished 17th in 1992–93.[7]\n",

      "From the beginning of the 2016–17 season, ticket prices for away fans were capped at £30 per ticket.[9]\n",
      "Antonio Conte enjoyed a successful start as Chelsea manager, winning the title in his first season at the club and earning a record number of league victories for a season, with only poor early form preventing them from also setting a new points total. Tottenham Hotspur shrugged off a disappointing Champions League campaign to push Chelsea close for the title, though they ultimately missed out. However, they finished the season with statistically both the best attack and defence, with striker Harry Kane once again claiming the Golden Boot. Furthermore, the season marked the end of Tottenham's 118-year stay at the White Hart Lane stadium, temporarily using Wembley for the subsequent season, before a new stadium move.[10] Manchester City finished one spot better than the previous season in Pep Guardiola's first season in charge, though ended the season trophy-less, despite recording the third-best attack and reaching the semi-finals of the FA Cup. Liverpool made the Champions League for the first time in three years in Jürgen Klopp's first full season, though they were prevented from finishing any higher than fourth by an inconsistent start to 2017, a consequence of both losing their £35 million signing Sadio Mané to international duty in January and February as well as suffering from several dropped points against bottom-half teams.\n",
      "Despite winning seven of their final eight games, Arsenal finished fifth and failed to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 1997, as fan pressure on both manager Arsène Wenger and majority-shareholder Stan Kroenke grew. While they did win the FA Cup for the third time in four seasons, making Wenger the most successful manager in the competition's history, they endured yet another disappointing Champions League run, eliminated at the round of 16 for a seventh successive year. Manchester United finished sixth, one lower than the previous season, in José Mourinho's first season in charge, with their failure to turn any one of their 15 draws – with 12 earned amidst the season-record 25 matches unbeaten run – into victories proving problematic. They did at least win the EFL Cup and won the Europa League final. The latter was the first Europa League title in their history, not only securing a place in the Champions League but also made them only the fifth club to have won all three major European trophies. Everton, the final team to qualify for the UEFA competitions, made their first return to that level for 3 years. Under Ronald Koeman, who replaced Roberto Martínez following his sacking towards the end of the previous season after a period of mid-table stagnation, the club would spend virtually the entire season in the Europa League places; never mounting any serious push for the Champions League places, but always remaining well clear of the rest of the league. This also meant that for the fourth time in seven seasons, the top seven positions were occupied by the same teams.\n",
      "In only their second-ever top-flight season, AFC Bournemouth built on the success of the previous season as they secured a ninth-place finish and scored 55 goals, defying the critics who had tipped them to struggle from second-season syndrome. Much as Chelsea had the previous season, Leicester City made a poor defence of their title, despite having what turned out to be the best Champions League run of any English club this season. They were beaten by Hull City in the first match, the first time this has happened to a reigning Premier League champion. With the club struggling, manager Claudio Ranieri was sacked in February and replaced by coach Craig Shakespeare, who steered the club to 12th. It broke the record of the lowest finish for Premier League title holders, set by Chelsea the previous season by finishing 10th, but comfortably clear of relegation.\n",
      "Swansea City had looked dead and buried after early struggles under Francesco Guidolin and then a disastrous spell with Bob Bradley as manager, but were saved by a late improvement under Paul Clement's management. Burnley fared the best of the promoted clubs, with only atrocious away form preventing them finishing higher as they made their home-ground of Turf Moor one of the hardest places to get a point from – and secured a second successive top-flight season for the first time in 40 years. Watford, in their first successive top-flight campaign for 30 years, successfully ensured a third consecutive Premier League season – however, as a result of poor away form, a disastrous end to the season and several spells of indifferent form throughout the campaign, the Hornets were unable to really build on the previous season despite recording their first league victories over Manchester United and at Arsenal since the 1980s.\n",
      "After several successive escapes from relegation, Sunderland's resilience finally broke and they dropped into the Championship after a decade, having spent virtually the entire season rooted to the bottom of the table. Middlesbrough also struggled through their first top-flight season in eight years, with a poor end to the season, the weakest goal-scoring record in the division and an inability to turn one of their 13 draws into victories dooming them. Hull City were the final relegated side, never quite recovering from a disastrous pre-season which saw manager Steve Bruce quit and next to no new players signed. Despite encouraging early season form under Mike Phelan, a dismal run in the winter saw him sacked and replaced by Marco Silva, who steered the club to a much better second half of the season, but it ultimately proved to be a case of too little, too late.\n",
      "Twenty teams competed in the league – the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the Championship. The promoted teams were Burnley, Middlesbrough and Hull City. Burnley and Hull City returned to the top flight after a season's absence while Middlesbrough returned after a seven-year absence.

Any player whom the three-man panel unanimously decided had caused an opponent to be sent off or had won a penalty as a result of deceiving the referee by simulation would be charged by the Football Association with \"Successful Deception of a Match Official\" which carried a penalty of suspension for two matches. Everton striker Oumar Niasse became the first Premier League player to be punished under the new rule.[10]\n",
      "Manchester City were confirmed as Premier League champions following Manchester United's 0–1 defeat at home to West Bromwich Albion in the 33rd round. Manchester City had started the Premier League season with an away win over Brighton & Hove Albion in August. After a draw against Everton, Manchester City won eighteen games in a row. During this time they secured first position and held it for the remainder of the season. On 7 April, Manchester City hosted Manchester United in the local derby, in which a win would have secured their position as champions. United came back from 2-0 down at half-time to win 3-2 and deny their rivals the title; however, the following week they lost to bottom club West Bromwich Albion, a result which, coupled with Manchester City's victory over Tottenham Hotspur, ensured an unassailable lead with five games left.[11]\n",
      "During the campaign Manchester City broke and set several new club and English football records. They established national records in consecutive away (11) and overall (20) victories in all competitions; set a new English record for consecutive league wins (18); equalled the Premier League record for consecutive away league wins (11) and set club records by achieving 28 consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions; 30 consecutive games unbeaten in the league; 20 consecutive home wins in all competitions; and winning 14 away games in a season.[12][13][14][15] They won their fifth English league title, and completed their second league and League Cup double in four years.\n",
      "Defending champions Chelsea started the season badly, losing their opening game to Burnley 2–3; the first time the holders were defeated at home in their first match. A win at one of the title favourites, Tottenham, in their second game seemed to get their defence back on track, but results in September, including losing 0–1 to Manchester City, left them six points behind the leaders in fourth place. They failed to show the consistency of the previous season, and finished in fifth place, leading to Antonio Conte's dismissal as manager a year after leading them to the title. \n",
      "Manchester United started the season strongly winning their first three games without conceding a goal and led the table until mid-September. They finished in 2nd, their highest finish and points total (81) since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson. \n",
      "Liverpool finished fourth for a second consecutive season, buoyed by the signing of Mohamed Salah; his 32 goals broke a Premier League record for most goals scored in a 38-game season, beating the 31 achieved by Cristiano Ronaldo, Alan Shearer and Luis Suarez.\n",
      "Arsenal had a poor season, finishing sixth overall. Long-serving manager Arsène Wenger announced his departure from the club on 20 April 2018.[16] Their final home game was an emphatic 5–0 defeat of Burnley which guaranteed qualification to the group stage of the Europa League.[17]\n",
      "Despite the defeat, Burnley finished in seventh place, their best finish in English football since 1973–74. This meant they would be entered into the second qualifying round of the Europa League, their first competitive European football campaign in 50 years.[18] Their strong finish led to manager Sean Dyche and defender James Tarkowski being nominated for the Premier League Manager of the Season and Premier League Player of the Season awards respectively.[19]\n",

This made Huddersfield the second team in Premier League history to be relegated before March ended, following Derby County in 2007–08.[15] Fulham joined them after a 1–4 defeat at Watford on 2 April, relegated with five games remaining.[16] Cardiff City were the final team to be relegated following a 2–3 loss at home to Crystal Palace on 4 May with one game remaining.[17]\n",

The season started on 9 August 2019 and concluded on 26 July 2020.[5] Manchester City were the defending champions for the second successive year, after picking up the domestic treble the previous season. Liverpool won their first league title since 1990, the club's first of the Premier League era and nineteenth overall.\n",
      "Over the season, Liverpool set a number of English top-flight records including the earliest title win (with seven games to spare),[6] the biggest points lead at any time (25),[7] and the most consecutive home wins (24, of which 7 were carried over from the previous season).[7]\n",
      "The season was halted for over three months, following a decision on 13 March 2020 by the Premier League to suspend the league after a number of players and other club staff became ill due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The initial suspension, until 4 April, was then extended to mid-June.[3] The season recommenced with two matches on 17 June and a full round of matches played over the weekend of 19–22 June.[8]\n",

      "The Premier League season marked the start of a new three-year TV deal. One key change was that eight matches were shown on television at 19:45 on Saturdays across the season, broadcast by Sky Sports.[11] Further, Amazon broadcast two rounds of fixtures in December, including the Merseyside derby, marking the first time an entire round of live matches had been broadcast domestically.[12]\n",
      "It was the first Premier League season to have a mid-season break in February. Three games of a normal round of ten were played on the weekend 8–9 February 2020, six games on the following weekend 14–17 February and the tenth game, Manchester City versus West Ham United, was rescheduled from 9 February to 19 February due to Storm Ciara. Games played on the same day had separate time slots such that the games did not overlap.[13]\n",
      "With Manchester City and Liverpool achieving 98 and 97 points respectively in the 2018–19 season, many expected another close race for the title. Liverpool started the season in strong form with eight consecutive wins, while City suffered shock defeats to newly promoted Norwich City and Wolverhampton Wanderers.[14]  Liverpool's 3–1 win over City at Anfield in November opened up an 8-point lead at the top of the table and they maintained their lead for the remainder of the season.  \n",
      "On 25 June 2020, Manchester City lost 2–1 to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, mathematically confirming Liverpool as champions and marking their first league title in 30 years, and their first of the Premier League era.[15]\n",

      "On 25 October 2019, Leicester City broke the Premier League record – as well as the all-time English top-flight record – for the largest away league win and equalled the biggest ever Premier League win when they defeated Southampton 9–0 at St Mary's Stadium.[17]\n",
      "During the season, Liverpool broke or tied several Premier League all-time records. They achieved a record-equalling 18 consecutive wins[18] before being defeated by Watford on 29 February.

      "On 12 January 2020, in a 6–1 victory over Aston Villa, Manchester City's Sergio Agüero broke Thierry Henry's Premier League record for most goals scored by an overseas player.[19] In the same match, he also broke the record for most hat-tricks scored by a single player (12), previously held by Alan Shearer.[20]\n",

      "Since March, the season was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.[26] On 10 March, the match between Manchester City and Arsenal, due to be played the next day after being rescheduled due to City's participation in the 2020 EFL Cup Final, was postponed. A number of Arsenal players had made close contact with Olympiacos owner Evangelos Marinakis, who had tested positive for infection with the coronavirus, when the two teams had met in the Europa League 13 days earlier.[27] It is the first football season in England to be halted since the 1939–40 season was abandoned after only three games following the outbreak of the Second World War.[28]\n",
      "On 12 March, it was revealed that three Leicester City players were self-isolating.[29] Manchester City announced that their defender Benjamin Mendy was also self-isolating, after a family member displayed symptoms of the virus.[30] Later in the evening, it was then confirmed that Arsenal head coach Mikel Arteta had tested positive for coronavirus.[31] As a result of Arteta's positive test, the match between Brighton & Hove Albion and Arsenal, scheduled for 14 March at the Amex, was postponed.[32] On 13 March, Chelsea announced that their winger Callum Hudson-Odoi had tested positive for coronavirus.[33]\n",
      "On 13 March, following an emergency meeting between the Premier League, The Football Association (FA), the English Football League and the FA Women's Super League, it was unanimously decided to suspend professional football in England until at least 4 April 2020.[2] On 19 March, the suspension was extended to at least 30 April 2020.[34] At the same time the FA agreed to extend the season indefinitely, past the scheduled end date of 1 June. In April 2020, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, called on Premier League players to take a pay cut during the pandemic.[35] The PFA rejected the call as they felt that a cut for all players would impact the Exchequer with a loss of income tax revenue.[36] Several clubs, including Watford, Southampton and West Ham United, all agreed to defer their wages.[37] Later in April, the Premier League produced a plan, nicknamed \"Project Restart\", aimed at restarting the league and playing all 92 remaining matches over a six-week period at approved, neutral stadiums.[38] Watford, Aston Villa and Brighton, all near the bottom of the table, were of the opinion that it would be unfair to play the games in such different conditions when at risk of relegation but would be more in favour if the threat of relegation was removed.[39][40] From 19 May 2020, players were allowed to return to group training in preparation for restarting the league. They were permitted to be in groups of no more than five with all training sessions lasting no longer than 75 minutes for each player.

A plan was announced for all remaining matches to be televised, and to widen the availability of domestic broadcasts: for the first time, the BBC gained rights to broadcast four live matches on free-to-air television, while Sky announced plans to carry 25 matches on its free-to-air channel Pick.[54] Amazon were allotted four matches. and announced it would provide a means of streaming them for free without an Amazon Prime subscription; on 18 June it was announced that these matches would be carried on its video game live streaming service Twitch.[55][56]\n",

      "Further tests for the virus were carried out on 11 and 12 June. Two unnamed people provided a positive result including one player from Norwich City who would be required to self-isolate thereby missing the first fixture of the restarted season. Following these tests there had been 16 positive results from 8,687 tests.[60]\n",
      "Before the restart of games the Premier League produced a set of guidelines to be followed at all games. They stipulated that all matches must be played behind closed doors, with the number of key people allowed inside the stadium limited to 300. All stadiums are divided into three zones — red (includes pitch and technical areas), amber (stands) and green (stand concourses) — and there are restrictions on who is allowed to enter each. There is staggered entry on to the pitch for players and staff and no handshakes are allowed before kick-off. Deep cleaning of corner flags, goalposts, substitution boards and match balls takes place before and after each fixture as standard. Extra disinfection, such as of the substitution board after it is used, is likely during matches and at half-time. Additional measures include that players and coaching staff must observe social distancing rules when travelling to and from games, and post-match broadcast interviews must take place pitchside with press conferences conducted virtually.[61]\n",

The promoted teams were Norwich City, Sheffield United and Aston Villa. Norwich City and Aston Villa returned to the top flight after absences of three years, while Sheffield United returned after a twelve-year absence. They replaced Cardiff City, Fulham (both teams relegated after one season back in the top flight) and Huddersfield Town (relegated after two years in the top flight). Cardiff City's relegation means that this season was the first without a side from Wales since the 2010–11 season.\n",

      "On 22 February 2021, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced as the third step of recovery from the lockdown imposed on 4 January, that subject to certain criteria being met on vaccines, infection rates and new coronavirus variants, large football stadiums would be allowed to reopen on 17 May with a maximum of 10,000 spectators or 25% capacity, whichever was higher.[8] This meant that the final round of fixtures scheduled for the 23 May would see spectators return to the stadium. To ensure all clubs played their final home game in front of fans, the penultimate round of fixtures were rearranged to take place on 18–19 May. No away fans were permitted for these matches.[9]\n",
      "The 2020–21 season began on Saturday 12 September, just seven weeks after the conclusion of the 2019–20 season.[10] Liverpool were the defending champions, having won their nineteenth league title the previous season, their first in the Premier League era.[2] As originally planned, the 2020–21 season was to be the second Premier League season with a mid-season break in February, whereby five games of a normal round of ten would be played on one weekend and the remaining five the following weekend.[11] However, due to the late start of the league and fixture congestion, the winter break was scrapped.[12] It is also the second Premier League season to use VAR (Video Assistant Referee).[13]\n",
      "The top of the table was tight for the first months of the season, with Arsenal, Leicester City, Everton, Liverpool and Southampton all having occupied first position by early November.[14] The top six were separated by only three points at that stage.[15] Tottenham Hotspur became the sixth different leader later that month,[16] but Liverpool overtook them again mid-December, following a meeting between the two clubs at Anfield which resulted in a 2–1 win to Liverpool.[17] By Christmas, Liverpool had opened up a five-point gap following a 7–0 away win against Crystal Palace.[18]\n",
      "In the new year, Liverpool suffered from a significant slump in form, dropping to 8th place by early March.[19] They suffered their first home defeat in 69 games with a 1–0 defeat to Burnley,[20] which began a run of six consecutive losses at Anfield, following losses to Brighton & Hove Albion, Manchester City, Everton, Chelsea and Fulham.[19] Manchester United took the lead at the top of the table in mid-January with a 1–0 away win against Burnley,[21] but they were in turn replaced by Manchester City at the end of the month as a 5–0 Manchester City win over West Bromwich Albion was followed by a 2–1 home defeat for Manchester United against Sheffield United.[22][23]\n",
      "This was to prove the final change of team at the top, as Manchester City went on a 15-match winning streak which saw them 15 points clear of second-place Manchester United after a 4–1 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 2 March.[24] They went on to secure the title on 12 May 2021 with three matches to spare, following a home defeat for Manchester United against Leicester.

Although Liverpool were 8th with ten games remaining, a run of eight wins from their final ten games, including a 95th-minute winner scored by goalkeeper Alisson against West Bromwich Albion, saw them recover their position to finish 3rd and qualify for a fifth straight season.[26] Chelsea endured a difficult start to the season under Frank Lampard, who was sacked in January with the club in 9th position and replaced by Thomas Tuchel. The club's form improved under Tuchel to secure a second consecutive finish in 4th place, despite a final day defeat to Aston Villa.[27] They won in that season's Champions League final the next week, in the competition's third all-English final against champions Manchester City.\n",
      "Leicester enjoyed a successful season, spending more time in the top four places than any other club; however, three defeats in their final four games, including a home defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on the final day, saw them narrowly finish in 5th for a second consecutive season.[28] Having narrowly avoiding relegation the previous season, West Ham United surprised many by finishing 6th, their highest finish since 1998–99.[29] Both these clubs earned qualification to the Europa League for the following season.\n",

Mason was unable to improve the club's position and they finished 7th, their lowest finish since the 2008–09 season, but still good enough to qualify for the brand new third tier Europa Conference League competition.[citation needed] Meanwhile, their traditional North London rivals Arsenal endured an even worse campaign; eight defeats in their first 14 games left them in 15th just before Christmas and seemingly in danger of being sucked into a relegation battle. Whilst they would pick up enough points thereafter to pull away from the bottom half of the table, the Gunners could only finish 8th for a second successive season; they failed to qualify for European competition for the first time since the 1994–95 season.\n",

This also marked the first time in the Premier League era that all three teams have been relegated with more than two games to spare.[32] In contrast, the final promoted team, Leeds United, finished in 9th with 59 points, the highest points tally for a newly promoted side since Ipswich Town in 2000–01 (66 points).[citation needed]\n",

This was also Brentford's first season in the Premier League.[41] They replaced Fulham, West Bromwich Albion (both teams relegated after just one year in the top flight) and Sheffield United (relegated after a two-year top flight spell).[42]\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEmber Lab celebrates one year since releasing their debut game with a trove of free new content.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt’s been one year since our launch. To celebrate, we’re thrilled to share our biggest update yet – the Anniversary Update! As a thank you for your amazing support we’ve expanded the Kena experience with many new features, including: New Game+, Charmstones, Spirit Guide Trials, Kena Outfits, accessibility features, and more.The Anniversary Update will be a free update available to all PS4 and PS5 players, new and old, on September 27.During development, we aimed to take fans’ comments into consideration while also adding more unique features and gameplay to expand the experience. New Game+ has been a big one! Once players have completed the game, they will have the opportunity to convert their save file into a New Game+ game. From there, they will restart Kena’s journey with all of their previously unlocked Abilities, Upgrades, Outfits, Rot, etc. as they face redesigned and more challenging combat encounters. Combat encounters adjustments even include new enemy types unique to NG+. Many bosses even have some additional phases.Charmstones are another big addition coming in our September 27 update. Individually equipable – these unique collectibles each provide different adjustments to Kena’s stats and abilities. Some Charmstones contain a benefit and a drawback, encouraging players to strategize about how they want to take on certain enemies and challenges. Rare Cursed Charmstones are aimed at players who want a serious challenge by attacking the game with reduced abilities. Players will find most Charmstones hidden around Kena’s world, with a few connected to another big addition: Spirit Guide Trials.In a whole new game mode accessed from the Mask Shrine, the Spirit Guide Trials will challenge players’ skills. By building a variety of replayable challenges, we wanted to encourage all players to test out different combinations of their upgrades and deepen their combat experience. The Spirit Guide Trials fall into three different categories: Obstacle Courses, Wave Defenses, and Boss Reflects. Each Trial can be played as many times as players want and include various objectives to complete within that particular Trial. In the Obstacle Courses for example, players focus on Kena’s primary abilities: the Bow, Bomb, and Dash as they navigate through courses designed to test their accuracy, timing, and platforming. Wave Defenses pit players against multiple rounds of increasingly difficult enemies. They must think strategically while pacing themselves through multiple waves of unique scenarios with limited chances to heal. We’ve prepared some pretty exciting and hair-raising enemy combinations here, so be prepared.Finally, Boss Reflects allow players to revisit their favorite boss fights and perfect their tactics. While we love the excitement of all of our smaller combat encounters, we’re particularly fond of a good bossfight. We wanted to make sure players had the opportunity to retry these exciting events to their hearts’ content within one playthrough, experiment with new approaches, and become true masters.What about the rewards? By completing Trials, players have the opportunity to unlock Outfits for Kena, each one inspired by one of the characters she meets along her journey. Succeeding at bonus objectives within each trial can unlock color variations of each outfit, as well as some unique Charmstones. There’s even an exclusive outfit for Deluxe Edition owners.We hope players enjoy replaying or continuing their playthrough of Kena: Bridge of Spirits with these constant reminders of the special characters Kena helps along her journey as a Spirit Guide. (Plus, we also just think they look pretty cool). Even as we’ve been testing them, every time we play with a different outfit, we’re reminded of helping Beni and Saiya find their brother for the first time, or learning how to channel the bow from Rusu.We can’t wait to share all of these additions with the Anniversary Update on September 27.\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGhost Pattern reveals never-before-seen development details for the immersive theater-inspired game, out September 15.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHey, I’m Goldie, the art director for Wayward Strand, coming to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on September 15 (that’s so soon!!)For the first time in the six years since Ghost Pattern was formed, me and the team are sharing a deep dive into the making of our real-time, simultaneously told story, Wayward Strand, starring Casey, a 14-year-old aspiring journalist, as she follows her curiosity wherever it takes her.Early artwork of how the ship might be loaded up with supplies, by me! Goldie BartlettFrom the start, the game was heavily inspired by immersive theater, slice-of-life comics, and graphic novels. Something I love about this format is that there’s a lot of space and area to tuck moments in amongst the larger plot points and knots of storylines.Our team created Wayward Strand’s characters based on personal experiences and stories from people in our lives, particularly older people. We wanted our characters to be active within the story, as opposed to waiting around for the player to come by before they do anything. Georgia Symons, one of Wayward Strand’s writers, remembers that “the goal was to give each character the potential to ‘move the story forward’, through whatever actions they take.”In early demos we were excited by how simultaneous storylines give the player the opportunity to happen upon scenes or storylines in mid-flow. It helps the player both understand and feel that there is a world of activity going on outside of their character.Ghost Pattern’s earliest mock-up of the Day 1 schedule in 2016/2017. Each row, a different character and each column a time of day.Wayward Strand’s other writer, Jason Bakker, feels like telling many storylines at the same time means we can really round out our characters. “It allows each character to have quiet moments, time to themselves. Each character can be the centre of attention for a bit, then the player can follow them as they return to their rooms, and be with them as they process what just happened.”Screenshot of the current build, at the front of the ship overlooking the coast.We’ve challenged ourselves to make every character as interesting as possible over the course of three in-game days, and that’s a part of making Wayward Strand I’ve absolutely loved. Often I’d have a conversation with someone — my mum or an aunty or a friend — they’d tell me some story about someone they once knew and I’d think, “that is SUCH an Esther thing to do” or ‘that’s exactly how Joe (one of the nurses) must be feeling about Dr. Bouchard’. Over the past six years, little nuances that relate to people we know have been added to the characters piece by piece.An early rendering of Casey visiting Ida using 3D modeling.We’ve gone through many generations of the visuals for our living world. Our first plans were to explore fully-3D spaces in an over-the-shoulder format, within a single-story hospital; when you went into a scene, the camera would cut around as each character spoke. In that demo, we weren’t seeing the larger backdrop of the busyness of the hospital, or even the beautiful sea/skies outside, and decided to go in a fundamentally different direction.A scrapped layout of the ship, where the rooms were laid out widthwise.Maize Wallin, our audio director, says the change to a side-on view is one of the key experiential differences. “This side-on doll’s house view makes it much clearer to the player that there’s constantly things happening around them.” We built our next demo in a side-on style, where the camera looked “down the barrel” of the ship, and rooms were laid out widthwise. Only after working with Su-Yiin Lai, an architectural consultant, did we discover that lengthwise was the best way to achieve the comic-book style we were hoping for – this was the final rebuild, and what you’ll see in game.An early design of the lengthwise hospital airship.How the ship looks today!One thing we’ve been confident in since the very early days is that the game should be fully voiced; as well as wanting the game to benefit from actors’ performances, like theater, we needed the player to be able to hear all the conversations going on around you as you play. We did two rounds of ‘practice’ voice-over recording sessions in 2016 and 2018, which taught us that the voice-over production for the full-game would be a massive undertaking.And it was – over the course of six weeks we spent 30 days with our actors, across four studios around the world. Maize, the technical audio director for the VO sessions, says we’ve recorded over 18,000 lines of dialogue; the equivalent of about eighteen feature-length movies. It took cohesive narrative direction, programming, technical audio, and audio engineering and voiceover audio specialists to make it all possible.Casey is heard making many hellos!As we’ve gotten close to release, we’ve been watching people play the game and realised although many things have changed along the journey, our core goals never wavered. When you play Wayward Strand, you’re spending time in a living world surrounded by interesting, complex characters and their evolving stories, inspired by personal experience and real history.We’re so excited for you to experience it yourself on September 15, on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4!\n",

More info Meet Your Maker revealed, a brutal new take on building and raiding\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Explore the gameplay, world, and lore of Behaviour Interactive’s next major release, coming in 2023.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHot on the heels of its world premiere reveal, we’re here to take you even deeper into the brutal world of Meet Your Maker. Let’s start with a quick recap of the game itself, coming to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 in 2023. Meet Your Maker is a new first-person building-and-raiding game set in a dark post-apocalyptic future. Gameplay revolves around the creation and infiltration of stand-alone levels called Outposts, as players seek to protect or steal the world’s most precious remaining resource from each other. Building is focused on strategic, block-based design, where players will draw from a highly customizable toolbox of traps and guards to mastermind deadly maze-like Outposts. Raiders, on the other hand, will suit up for methodical, lightning-fast combat as they enter and attempt to overcome other players’ creations. The experience is one truly driven by user-generated content, and every single Outpost in the game is designed by players, for players. While the unique gameplay of Meet Your Maker takes center stage at first glance, similar to Behaviour’s long-running multiplayer horror hit Dead by Daylight, there’s also a rich mythology waiting to be discovered. Communicate with the Chimera via a unique psychic bond.“Humanity has been facing extinction ever since a genetic disease swept the globe hundreds of years ago,” explains Joe Dermo, Meet Your Maker’s lead narrative designer. “Desperate nations waged war over resources, riots broke out, and societies collapsed. However, humanity didn’t roll over and die.“There was an era where several gifted world leaders proposed Sanctuaries—highly advanced research labs across the world that could work independently and cooperatively on world-saving initiatives. One such initiative was the Chimera Project, which would create hybrid-humans by distilling uncorrupted genetic material through those who have shown resistance to the disease. “After hundreds of years, the project continues towards its goal, though the evolution of the Chimera has gone down an unexpected path…”.A harvester loads genetic material into the shipping station for transport back to the Sanctuary.Players will assume the role of the Custodian, a clone tasked with seeking out the remaining uncorrupted genetic material and either defending or stealing it. You are the last hope for completing the Chimera Project – but gathering this coveted resource won’t be easy.“Uncorrupted genetic material is exceedingly rare due to this disease that’s swept the world, yet it’s the one thing needed to complete the Chimera Project and hopefully bring about a cure, “continues Joe. “As it dwindles in supply, Sanctuaries led by Chimera have begun to fight over it.”The fight in question takes place within Outposts built by players to extract genetic material. The heart of each Outpost is its extractor cube, filling canisters with the precious resource. Builders will need to tap into their most devious impulses, creating a gauntlet of traps and monstrous guards designed to lure, outwit, and tear trespassing players limb from limb. Raiders will need sharp reflexes, anticipation, and perseverance to not only fight their way to the extractor cube and steal its canister, but also escape with it in hand. “The scarcity of genetic material really drives the two sides of the game in Meet Your Maker,” shares Ash Pannell, the game’s Creative Director. “Making the building blocks of life the driving narrative concept helps to raise the stakes. It allows us to create gameplay themes that are morally grey, asking the question, ‘What is humanity? The physical stuff we’re made out of – or something more?’”Speak with any of the Sanctuary’s five Advisors, your only allies in an unforgiving world.Between building and raiding sessions, players will return to the Sanctuary, their hub and base of operations. In addition to the Chimera, the Sanctuary also houses five Advisors; clones who run the facility. Progression is achieved by supplying both them and the Chimera with genetic material which unlocks new traps, guards, suits, weapons, perks, and even lore for those eager to peel back the layers of this dying world. “Speaking to your Advisors is a great way to learn about the world’s lore,” explains Joe. “Occasionally, they’ll mention something that touches on the greater history and hints at upcoming stories for them. And for those looking to deep dive into the mythology of Meet Your Maker, our ever-growing Codex has a history of every item and character in the game.”Through new content and an ever-expanding toolbox, this is a game that will only get bigger over time, and fans can rest assured its mythology will continue to expand alongside it. “Though a lot is still in the planning phase, we’ll be looking at ways that players can actively seek out lore and uncover new – and sometimes shocking – information about the world and characters they interact with.”Meet Your Maker releases in 2023 on PS4 and PS5.\n",

More info Playground and Duos mode revealed for Rumbleverse launch, out August 11\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPartner up with a fellow Rumbler in Duos and grapple at your own pace in the Playground mode.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHey PlayStation Nation! The launch of Rumbleverse — the free-to-play, 40-person brawler — is nearly here! On August 11 the Battle Barge will officially open its slipway to all Rumblers as a free download on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5. Get ready; this is the start of your exciting career as a Rumbler!  You’re invited to Grapital City, where everyone lives for the fight and dreams of becoming a champion. Create your unique fighter and prepare to be shot out of a cannon, where you and 39 other contestants are launched into the streets of Grapital City to rumble. Dash through streets and scale buildings in search of upgrades, found on every corner and rooftop in the city. Then pick a fight, flex your moves, knock out your opponents, and be the last Rumbler standing.So, what’s new for launch?We really enjoyed watching you all strive to be a Solo Mode champion during our playtest sessions. The fun really begins on August 11th, when Duos Mode goes live. Fight side by side with a friend, share loot, protect each other, and win together! Duos Mode takes all the moment-to-moment gameplay you know and love from our Solo Brawler Royale experience and twists it into something brand new.  Every situation takes on a new set of strategic questions for you and your partner to answer. Want to risk landing on a hotspot like the Trophy Heights Water Tower to get all that loot?  If one of you gets thrown off, the other will be left without backup, raising the stakes. Want to move and loot together? If you stay too close, you’ll be collecting and sharing one player’s worth of items.  If you separate too much, you may be vulnerable to sneak attacks from aggressive Duos that leave you outnumbered.In Duos Mode, you start with only eight slots for your stats, and a bit less Max Health than you do when you play alone. Additionally, you won’t have access to the Superstar Comeback system. If your teammate gets eliminated, you will get additional Max Health and Stat Slots awarded to you to help keep you in the fight.  Don’t worry though, as running out of Health in Duos mode won’t KO you right away.If your teammate runs out of health, they’ll be Downed and in need of Help. To Help your teammate, simply stand near them and press the Interact button (Circle) to cheer them back to their feet. You’ll have 30 seconds to do so, but if your teammate is Downed again, you’ll get progressively less time to help them. Sounds simple?  It is… until enemy teams are hovering over your friend trying to stop you.  Try using the Vicious Blast (hold Triangle) or activating your Superstar Mode to push opponents away from your friend, and then help them up as quickly as you can. As a bonus, if you attempt to help a teammate while Superstar Mode is activated, you’ll help them up twice as fast.Communication and teamwork are the key to victory. Share items. Go for complimentary builds. Help each other when enemies are attacking. You can knock your teammates down, but you won’t hurt them (unless water is involved). If you want a real thrill, try tossing an enemy into the air and letting your teammate connect a follow-up attack.  Create the team combos of your dreams and get your fans really amped up.Want to explore the city at your own pace and perfect your moves? Looking for a few lessons on how to play before you launch head-first out of a giant cannon?  Check out our free roam experience, Playground Mode. The city will be fully open to explore. Seek out training modules in different neighborhoods to learn gameplay lessons. Spar with the high-tech robots to help you unlock your inner champion. Explore on your own or with a friend. Enjoy Grapital City at your own speed. You can join a Playground server alone or with a friend.  If you bring a friend, you won’t be paired as a team.  This will allow you to fight each other or create your own fun in a multitude of ways.  If you are eliminated while you are in Playground, you can press the Option button to respawn nearby.Press Option to open the map screen and see the locations and topic names for all the lessons scattered around the city, as well as the locations of the Equip Up zones. You can also toggle Combat Mode on or off using the map screen.  If you toggle Combat Mode off, you can still interact with our robot training dummies, but other players will not be able to bother you.  When you arrive at a lesson location, you can use the training monitors to pop-up lessons. There are 8 topic locations with a huge variety of lessons to read.  Learn at your own pace; there is no need to read everything in one visit.Seek out an Equip Up zone if you want to mess around with any of the items that the Rumble has to offer. Here, you can find every special move in the game, as well as every weapon and every consumable.  And all of them will respawn! Try out everything to your heart’s content. Or just bring a friend and do foot races across the wide open city. Play it your way! You’ll have one week to warm up, stretch out, and practice your favorite super moves for the main event. Season One kicks off on August 18! The Season One Battle Pass is packed with 100 rewards you’ll unlock by earning Fame and progressing your Rumbler’s career. Rewards include accessories and accessory sets to customize your look, Title Cards, emotes, and more. Be sure to customize your Title Card on the Career page. Opponents you eliminate will get a glimpse of all the training you’ve put in.You’ll be able to purchase the Battle Pass from the shop for 1,000 Brawla Bills, Rumbleverse’s in-game currency. To sweeten the deal, completing the Battle Pass will earn you 1,500 Brawla Bills. It looks like someone skipped math class for leg day, folks. We’re not just launching a game — we’re beginning a journey. Stay tuned for a steady stream of updates, special events, and new ways to rumble.  The wait is almost over. The Rumble calls you. Will you answer?  \n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAlso added this month: Yakuza Kiwami, Yakuza Kiwami 2, Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands and more.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tToday we’re happy to reveal August’s Game Catalog lineup for PlayStation Plus, which will be available to play for Extra and Premium members on August 16. It’s headlined by three Yakuza games (which will soon be followed by other entries in the series later this year). But rubbing shoulders with the crime series will be multiplayer horror Dead by Daylight, open world shooter Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands and whimsical adventure Bugsnax. Let’s take a closer look at the lineup.The glitz, glamour, and unbridled decadence of the 80s are back in Yakuza 0. Fight like hell through Tokyo and Osaka with protagonist Kazuma Kiryu and series regular Goro Majima. Play as the former to discover how he finds himself in a world of trouble when a simple debt collection goes wrong. Then, step into the silver-toed shoes of Goro Majima and explore his “normal” life as the proprietor of a cabaret club. The first Yakuza title debuted in 2005 on PS2. This PS4 remake rebuilds that experience from scratch. Follow the early days of Kazuma Kiryu as he returns to the streets of Japan after serving a decade-long prison sentence for a crime he didn’t commit to save his best friend. Yakuza’s sequel receives the remake treatment, not only updating the original but expanding it with a playable adventure starring Goro Majima set before the events of the main game. A year after the events of the first Yakuza, an assassination pulls Kazuma Kiryu out of a peaceful life to broker peace between rival clans and face off against Ryuji Goda, known as the Dragon of Kansai. Dead by Daylight is a 1v4 multiplayer game that draws from all corners of the horror world from a powerful slasher to a terrifying paranormal entity. Choose between playing an unstoppable Killer and one of 4 Survivors trying to evade a gruesome death. Each character has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your personal strategy. Work together to escape, or stalk and sacrifice every Survivor.Create a team with up to 3 friends and enjoy the ultimate military shooter experience set in a massive, dangerous, and responsive open world. Create and fully customize your Ghost, weapons, and gear. Enjoy a total freedom of playstyle and discover stunning diverse landscapes both on and off road, in the air, on land, and at sea with over 60 different vehicles.Play an investigative journalist who has set out to explore Snaktooth Island, home to legendary half-bug half-snack creatures, Bugsnax. Discover, hunt and capture all 100 critters while also tracking down and reuniting the island’s inhabitants.Also available on August 16 are: \n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA deep dive into the creation of far-future Las Vegas with Guerrilla’s designers.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHorizon Forbidden West sees Aloy traverse dangerous and harsh environments in search of Gaia’s sub-functions, with hopes of restoring the planet’s terraforming system, rebalancing the biosphere and saving life on Earth. Though our story is set 1,000 years into the future, players will uncover and recognize many iconic locations from our real world today.DISCLAIMER: Please note that this behind-the-scenes feature contains major spoilers for the storyline and many gameplay elements of Horizon Forbidden West. To get the most out of this in-depth article, we would strongly recommend completing the quest The Sea of Sands prior to reading.During the quest The Sea of Sands, Aloy ventures into the arid Stillsands Desert in her search for Poseidon, one of Gaia’s sub-functions. At first, the desert appears desolate, however, hidden under the sands are the flooded ruins known as Dunehollow, formerly Las Vegas.It is up to Aloy to piece together data fragments left behind a millennium earlier by a businessman called Stanley Chen and reactivate the city’s long-forgotten water systems in order to gain access to Poseidon.Guerrilla Quest Designer Samantha Schoonen led the development of this quest, The Sea of Sands, from start to finish. To bring this vision to life, she did a lot of research on Vegas’ iconic Strip. “We looked into casinos and ideated on crazy ideas for far-future Vegas buildings,” says Schoonen. “I drew a lot of inspiration from our concept art as well, and we thought of things like a broken-down roller coaster area, remnants of a pirate ship, and a rooftop swimming pool – we worked a lot with our art departments to figure out what would work, though of course not everything made it into the final game.”Designing this epic questline was a long process full of iteration and collaboration, says Samantha. “For main quests, we always start out with a story summary provided by our Narrative team,” she says. “Based on that summary, we write a design document containing all information, like story beats, quest objectives, a world map of the area to provide an overview of the quest flow and locations, and a detailed description of these areas.“We then make an outline of the space. I use in-game reference images to get an idea of the level design and space itself, the outlines. But it’s hard to get a scale of the place while only working in 2D, so as soon as possible, I create a 3D layout in our Decima Engine. We then continue to iterate on flow and level design until everyone is satisfied.”“Building a quest that uses water was always going to be a challenge,” says Schoonen. “I remember how difficult it was to build the Waterlogged quest for Horizon Zero Dawn: Frozen Wilds, and of course, Las Vegas would be a lot bigger! We worked closely with various teams like tech, visual effects, and lighting to ensure we had the systems in place for underwater quests to function. We wanted to control where the water would be, as well as the air pockets, and visibility had to be adjustable.“We worked closely together with core design as well, who were in charge of the swimming mechanics. This would be the first quest where the player was able to dive to depths that were unreachable before.”Core Systems Designer Lennart Hoting worked on quite a few traversal aspects, including swimming and diving, which are new in Horizon Forbidden West. “We were looking for new heights and depths to explore and new types of natural beauty to showcase,” says Hoting. “As the underwater world is inherently fascinating and mysterious, it felt like a natural extension to traverse long-lost unknown places, such as Las Vegas. We consciously turned away from any oppressive tone of underwater gameplay and focused on fast and agile traversal, with enemy encounters revolving around stealth to add tension.“Early in development, we investigated which aspects of water could make for interesting gameplay challenges while also increasing immersion. Water currents soon came to mind. Aloy will sometimes encounter strong water currents that push her away from where she wants to go. You can attempt to sprint through them, but the best way to get through is to make use of underwater boost bars. Aloy can grab onto these and push off of them to gain a short burst of speed which can launch her straight through.”As Aloy acquires the Diving Mask, giving her unlimited air underwater, she plunges into the ruins of Vegas. “Our initial routes for traversal were way too long, so we decided to have a single elevator shaft to go up or down,” says Schoonen. “This shaft could not be too large due to the above-ground visuals, nor too small for the player to move around in or the elevator to be able to function once the quest was completed.“Once Aloy swims down the elevator shaft, she gets into a Casino space and eventually into the lobby. I really wanted the player to immediately be caught off guard by the Tideripper before becoming aware of the size of the space as a grand opening.”There are some rather dangerous machines in the waters of the Forbidden West, including Burrowers, Snapmaws, and the huge Tiderippers. “Aloy has no way of attacking while swimming, so she has to be smart and stealthy to circumvent enemies,” Hoting adds. “The best way to stay out of sight is to use smoke bombs or hide in kelp. These plants grow dense enough that they stop unaware machines from spotting you while giving you the opportunity to peek out while hiding inside. This creates a moment of extremely tactical cat-and-mouse gameplay.”Samantha continues on this subterranean location. “The underground dome is a dangerous place teeming with machines, so we added a few structures for the player to hide in as they move between hiding spots,” she says. “The machines are on patrol paths, which change whenever a node is activated. We then place the machines alongside the player’s route to their next location to create an ever-present threat.“A lot of the areas went through various iterations, as the building entrances, nodes, and sewers needed to be out of sight but not impossible to locate. Real-world Las Vegas sources its water from the Nevada Hoover Dam, so we wanted to convey something similar with the holographic map the player encounters early in the quest.“We were so inspired by Vegas and wanted to make the quest worthwhile. By putting in multiple elements, like tracking, combat, stealth, and small traversal puzzles, the player is given lots of variety in gameplay to make it feel fresh. It was definitely tricky to add enough elements without relying on combat and puzzles, which mostly rely on physics. That’s why we also added some air pocket spaces where the player could traverse and interact with the environment.”After Aloy successfully makes her way through the Snapmaw-infested waters and activates Stanley Chen’s ancient water management system, the water drains from the city. Suddenly, the scale of the dome, and the buildings within, becomes clear. Aloy must navigate them more traditionally by climbing, gliding, and running, with the dome becoming a large arena for an awesome battle.Remember that Tideripper mentioned earlier? With most of the water now drained from Dunehollow, Aloy will still need to deal with this challenging machine before finally getting to Poseidon.Samantha Schoonen explains how the arena for this battle was created. “We worked together with the combat team as this space required several elements to work,” she says. “the Tideripper needed a body of water to emerge from, so we built something of a beach where it could refill its Purgewater Sacs. The arena also needed to be quite deep so the player wouldn’t accidentally leave the area. Lastly, it needed a flat space for the Tideripper to move and, of course, grapple points to give Aloy a quick getaway – though some of those had to be destructible for an added challenge!”After defeating the Tideripper and obtaining Poseidon, Las Vegas truly comes back to life. Mesmerizing holograms illuminate the sky with ghostly outlines of buildings that collapsed long ago; memories of a forgotten city. “Having Vegas visually flourish was always part of the narrative vision for this quest,” Schoonen says with a smile. “Poseidon took over the Vegas water and power supply which was connected to the holograms. After Aloy fights the AI, the system fully reboots and the original holograms take their place lighting up the night sky. The quest’s ending was a huge collaboration; teams like concept art, cinematics, environment art, visual effects, and lighting all worked together on that beautiful moment. I only placed them in the right locations and made sure they showed up at the right time.“We all put a lot of love into building this area. I’m astonished by how well this quest has been received, and I’m happy to hear the community has had a great time playing through this underwater world!”As far as her own favorite moment, Samantha Schoonen finds this hard to choose. “For a designer, a game is never finished,” she says. “I’d have to look back ten years from now to have a clear opinion because I played through it so often during development. I think it’s more the entire journey of building this quest; that’s my favorite part.”And as for Lennart, he says, “I really liked seeing that many players enjoyed the underwater sections of the game and that some even said these were their favorite parts. The response to the Sea of Sands quest, and the love for unique characters like Morlund you meet along the way, was especially great; it is one of my favorite quests. While some players remained anxious about diving, the Diving Mask seemed to really turn these sections into something players enjoy. Reading that people were able to overcome their fears and enjoy the diving experience is amazing.”There’s much more to discover in and around Vegas following the Sea of Sands quest, now featuring a settlement called Hidden Ember; we’d definitely encourage you to return for a special quest with Morlund, speak to Porguf in Camp Nowhere, or deliver Ornaments to Stemmur, and wonder about the holidays of the Old Ones as they light up the Vegas skies.If you’re interested in more of the story behind the Vegas ruins, you can watch back our recent livestream with Samantha here (we’re live every Thursday at 4PM CEST, www.twitch.tv/guerrilla).\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Be prepared to step outside Appalachia’s borders this September with a primer on Expeditions. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFallout 76 players are about to venture into new territory. This September, the Expeditions update whisks players to a perilous location outside the wild reaches of Appalachia: The Pitt!Built on what’s left of Pre-War Pittsburgh, The Pitt is a rough place. The local Union faction is beset on all sides as bloodthirsty Raiders and once-human Trog beasts close in, so grab your friends, pack your best gear and steel yourself…it’s time to go on an Expedition.“Expedition missions are randomized and repeatable story-based missions on the scale of our most epic end-of-line quests, such as the Vault 79 raid at the end of Wastelanders,” explains Steve Massey, Lead Designer on Fallout 76’s Expeditions. “We developed a new Quest Module system which allows us to easily randomize and retheme quest objectives in order to make each mission playthrough feel truly unique and blend seamlessly into the overarching mission story.”Players can tackle missions either solo or in a group with up to four people – either with friends or by using the new Expedition Public Teams feature included in the update. Players can earn a unique item plan once per week upon completing an Expedition, as well as collect Stamps in order to claim specific items from the reward pool. Players can also earn repeatable rewards including legendary items, Scrip, Treasury Notes and even an all-new method for gaining Legendary Modules.Of course, there’s more to Expeditions than precious loot. Expeditions lets Fallout fans visit The Pitt for the first time since 2009’s add-on DLC for Fallout 3. With Fallout 76 set prior to the events of Fallout 3, Expeditions offer both exciting replayable missions, but also give players a chance to truly explore Pittsburgh in a fascinating era of Fallout lore, seeing the city in a new light…and previewing its coming darkness.“The team felt passionate about allowing players to explore other parts of the Fallout universe outside of Appalachia in this unique time period, only a few decades after the Great War,” Massey continues. “The Pitt was an obvious choice for the first city to visit, because in Fallout 3 it was such a bleak and unforgiving landscape that you ask yourself, ‘How did things get to be so bad?’.” In the future, the format of Expeditions also gives us the opportunity to take players to brand-new locales in the Fallout universe that no existing game has touched upon before.”While any player can sign up for an Expedition solo or as a group, be warned: It can get dangerous out there. It’s suggested that you first reach Level 50 or higher for the best experience stepping into The Pitt, with greater challenges awaiting solo Expeditionaries than those bringing along a few friends.“Much like other high-level story-based quests in the game, Expedition missions have combat tuned to be satisfying – but not overly punishing,” Massey says. “Players should come well-equipped, but all enemies drop relevant ammo and Stimpaks to help keep them going in the field.” Want to play with someone at a different level? Nothing to worry: Like other content in the game, enemies during Expeditions scale based on player level. “A low-level player can accompany a high-level friend on a mission and both will experience an appropriate level of difficulty,” assures Massey.Speaking of newer players, the Expedition update also includes other enhancements to the game such as adjusted starting gear and other additions benefiting fresh-faced Vault Dwellers just stepping out into Appalachia.“The Whitespring Resort has been completely revamped into a player hub called Whitespring Refuge,” says Massey. “Players will participate in Refuge Daily Quests, experience a brand-new random encounter system and repair/purchase/craft almost anything in the game that they want in the lower Whitespring Mall area. Additionally, the update comes with a ton of frequently requested quality-of-life changes, including the ability to fast-travel directly into the interiors of frequently visited locations like The Whitespring and The Rusty Pick without spending any Caps.”That’s the scoop on Expeditions – now it’s time to train up. Jump into Fallout 76 and explore, build and commune with players in your very own slice of post-nuclear West Virginia today! The Expedition update arrives free for Fallout 76 players this September, playable on both PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 systems. Until then, we’ll see you inside (and soon, outside) Appalachia!\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t The devil is in the details as Liam Edwards takes us through some of the deeper challenges awaiting us in Golf Purgatory. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe time has finally come, Cursed to Golf is out TODAY on PS5 and PS4. It’s been 2 years of hard work and passion to get here. The team and I are immensely proud of our game, and we hope you all take our virtual trip to the afterlife to live out your days in Golf Purgatory. Last time I was here I spoke about the general rules of supernatural golf, the incredible power of the Ace Cards and some of the shenanigans you can get down to in between holes. Today, let’s get down and dirty with some of the more perilous elements of Cursed to Golf. After all, if you want to make it out of Golf Purgatory, it pays to take some risks.At the end of each biome lies its ultimate challenge – the Legendary Caddie that oversees that part of the course. In Purgatory you’ll find The Scotsman, in the Desert you’ll face The Explorer, and the Caves are home to The Forgotten. These golf battles mix up the gameplay slightly and offer up a few differences to the traditional purgatorial golf gameplay you’ll encounter on the rest of the course. Not only do you have to keep tabs on your shot counter, but you also need to beat the boss by sinking your ball before them. However, in addition to Shot Idols that replenish your shot count, these battles include Stun Idols. Smashing through one of these will knock the boss down, making them miss a turn.These golfers don’t play around, hitting incredible shots that defy the laws of physics! If you want to take down a Legendary Caddie, you’ll need to master your Ace Cards, make use of the best shortcuts, and ensure to smash through a load of totems on your way to the flagpole. Luckily, the boss hole will always stay the same, so you can learn it as you play and experiment to find the best strategy to complete it.The Scotsman’s hole is designed for his characteristic long drives. It’s also peppered with both hazards and shortcuts both up high and down low, so don’t forget to use your Birdie Eye to get a true lay of the land and plan which road you want to take. Beating The Scotsman will unlock the “Comeback” boon, giving you the chance to place a checkpoint flag once per run. Upon your (almost certain) death, instead of being booted back to the beginning of the course, you’ll be transported back to your flag. Not only that, but you’ll have all the Ace Cards and cash you had when you placed it originally, ready for another swing at the course!The Explorer’s hole is a sand dune filled nightmare, expect to be perfecting your wedge game over there, because you’ll be landing in the bunker constantly. On top of that, The Explorer has a special ability – she can alter the hole right in the middle of it being played. You may land on a suspiciously flat and safe area, only to find a towering dune erupt out of the ground before you, sheesh! Beating The Explorer will net you the “Gimmie” boon, giving you 5 extra shots in a pinch when your shot count reaches 0. This powerful boon refreshes every hole, so don’t feel precious about it.The Forgotten’s Hole is a deep, cavernous maze full of diverging paths, deviously placed hazards, and tricksy false flagpoles that house golf ball eating dinosaurs. You’ll not only be contending with The Forgotten, but also her two pet birds Eagle and Albatross. These feathery blighters will stop at nothing to ensure The Forgotten beats you. If you land in one of their zones, they’ll whisk your ball away into a hazard, losing you shots and putting you in tough spots for your next swing.They’ll also grab The Forgotten’s ball and fly her past tough obstacles, dropping her in opportunistic positions for her next shot. There’s no way of sugarcoating it, this is one tough battle, but should you prevail, you will unlock the “Recovery” boon. With Recovery, upon death you’ll be able to keep your Ace Card deck and use it on your next run, giving you one big leg up straight from the beginning of Hole 1. Because we’re not complete masochists, once a boss is defeated, you don’t need to face them again on future runs and you get to keep their boons, too.Speaking of masochists, those of you who really want to risk it for the biscuit can take on CURSED HOLES! You’ll often find these at crossroads when you’re navigating the map in between holes. One route may have a pick-up and a standard hole, while the other will offer you extra goodies and a skull covered hole at the end of it. These cursed holes mix things up by triggering random modifiers every few shots. These ‘curses’ could include making your ball extra bouncy for a couple shots, restricting you to only be able to shoot in one direction, flipping the course upside down, and other pesky hindrances to your game. Beating a cursed hole will earn you extra cash and a card booster pack. In Golf Purgatory the saying is true – with high risk comes high reward.A course chock full of randomized dungeon-like holes, sneaky death traps, challenging bosses, and wicked curses; jeez does Golf Purgatory ever throw a lot at you. Well, if you make it past all of that to the 16th hole, you’ll be in HELL. Prepare for the ultimate challenge here. I won’t spoil what awaits you in Hell, but let’s just say it lives up to its namesake. Prepare to use all your golfing skills, Ace Card abilities and boons to survive Golf Purgatory’s last bastion before ascension. No golfer has ever managed to make it past here before, will you be the first? Only one way to find out, pick up Cursed to Golf on PS5 or PS4 today!\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe developers break down the herd of seven playable characters in this 2D fighter.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThem’s Fightin’ Herds (more lovingly called “TFH”) is a 2D fighting game developed by Mane6, a small team working hard to create an experience both newcomers and veterans of the genre will enjoy together. On October 18, players from around the world can finally join the stampede and play the game on PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 for the first time.In the mysterious and magical world of Fœnum, all manner of four-legged hooved creatures form societies, develop culture, and train for battle. Different regions and species in Foenum have elected champions to quest for a magical key with the power to lock the Predators away, all while earning glory and prestige for themselves and their own kind. Only one will be found worthy enough to wield this key, and the competition is fierce! Them’s Fightin’ Herds is a four-button fighter with Light, Medium, and Heavy attack buttons plus a Magic button to access a character’s unique abilities. Multiple attacks in sequence form combos, which are typically done by going from Light to Heavy then from Ground to Air. Special Moves are executed by performing an attack after a complex directional motion, like in traditional fighting games. Similarly, Super Meter builds during a fight, which can be spent to perform powerful Super Attacks.Chain together normal attacks, extend your combos with special moves, and finish off your opponent with highly damaging Super Attacks to win the round!Every character approaches combat in their own way, representing a mixture of archetypes familiar to fans of fighting games.Playstyle: Rushdown // GroundedDifficulty: EasyArizona is the youngest daughter of Texas and Minnesota, Head Bull and Cow of her cattlekind clan, nomads who roam The Prairie in search of greener pastures and open sky.Despite her size she possesses immense strength for kickin’, stompin’, and headbuckin’ opponents into submission. Her trusty lasso helps her continue combos and catch them unaware!Playstyle: ZonerDifficulty: MediumVelvet hails from Reine City, the posh center for Fœnum’s elite. She might not have much experience outside the city walls, but her talent and smarts keep her in perfect form regardless.No deer can hold a candle to Velvet in the practice of Winter Magic. She commands sharp icicles, frozen wind, and fancy dance moves to prevent opponents from getting close and spoiling ze floof!Playstyle: All-RounderDifficulty: MediumOleander was born deep in the secluded groves of The Woodlands among practitioners of Light Magic, but her frustration over the other unicorns’ indifference to the imminent Predator invasion drove her towards a darker path.Oleander has formed a pact with a demon known as FHTNG TH§ ¿NSP§KBL? (Fred for short) and now practices Dark Magic. Her varied Special Moves allow her great flexibility, but she must gain power through her Magic ability before she can use most of them.Playstyle: All-Rounder // TrickyDifficulty: MediumAlpacas live high up in the mountains among the ruins of a past civilization. The harsh environment turns most of them into grim stoics, but Paprika is a rare exception. She has a lot of love to give. Maybe too much. If only she could find somebody to give it to. Anybody. She’s not picky.Paprika thrives on chaos: zipping across the stage in the blink of an eye, tossing gifts from her picnic basket to distract opponents, all while setting up her powerful strikes and grabs.Playstyle: Puppet // SummoningDifficulty: HardPom never wanted to be a champion, but the pack of sheep dogs who’ve taken a liking to her seem to sense some hidden potential and urge her along despite her sheepish attitude towards danger.Pom calls upon and commands various types of these sheep dogs for her attacks. With practice, players can use her abilities to strike from unexpected angles and apply heavy pressure to their opponents.Playstyle: Rushdown // AerialDifficulty: EasyTianhuo is a Longma (half-dragon half-horse) and the captain of the royal guard in a proud nation of elite warriors sworn to protect the people of Fœnum. With finely-honed martial arts and deadly flame, Tianhuo dominates the skies. Quick attacks and high mobility help players get in, stay in, and keep them guessing.Playstyle: Rushdown // RunstopDifficulty: HardShanty is a young orphan from the Goatani Islands on a journey to prove herself worthy of joining a legendary pirate crew. She’s aiming big – her heart’s set on stealing the most valuable treasure in the world: that magic key everyone’s talking about!Using her Magic ability, Shanty can run at high speeds across the stage and even up walls to rush down and literally walk all over the competition!These seven characters make up the base roster for TFH, but more challengers are on their way.

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJoyMasher talks crafting the sci-fi aesthetic of its new ‘90s-style action platformer.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHi everybody, I’m Danilo from JoyMasher and I’m super excited to tell you more about Vengeful Guardian Moonrider, our next big game! And believe me, it’s quite a ride.After tackling the run ‘n’ gun genre with our previous game Blazing Chrome (inspired by timeless classics like Contra), I wanted with Vengeful Guardian Moonrider to keep the retro goodness of ‘90s action-platformers while updating the experience in fun new ways.For that, I dug deep into the territory of 16-bit games and even some early CD games, and tried to craft an authentic experience, just as if you just found in your basement an unreleased MegaDrive/Genesis game. For that, I for example used redbook style audio and even recorded speech in order to give Vengeful Guardian Moonrider an authentic feel of this era.But games were not our only inspiration for Vengeful Guardian Moonrider and I also tried to mix many different cultural influences I had during my childhood, playing amazing Japanese action games, watching dark anime and reading speculative and questionable pulp science-fiction novels. Genocyber, Cybernetic Guardians, Kamen Rider Black, and Hakaider were all rewatched to help chisel the type of universe in which Vengeful Guardian Moonrider takes place. Rewatching all those amazing shows was of course very serious work and not at all an excuse to spend some great quality time, hehe… All the character designs in Vengeful Guardian Moonrider, and general art direction of the game, were heavily inspired by Japanese artist Keita Amemiya, the designer behind lots of video games, anime, and tokusatsu from that era. I also took a lot of inspiration from H.R. Giger, the artist behind the otherworldly visuals of the Alien series.Most of the enemies have lots of biomechanical parts and have a very creepy feeling to them. The boss rooms’ backgrounds also have their share of body horror and organic elements, giving another good layer of that creepy feeling I was looking for while keeping a very cool look to them! I was also very much influenced by yokais (japanese demons) and their depiction in traditional Japanese art.As you must have guessed by now, references are very important to me and a great source of inspiration, and I think they were mandatory to get me to the proper mindset for creating a horrific sci-fi atmosphere you would like to explore. Everything in Vengeful Guardian Moonrider is harsh, dark, and moody, but not without reason. The story is also a dark tale about an alternate reality where an oppressive state uses its weapons – the guardians – to subdue other nations and its own people. Moonrider is a guardian that, after an incident, decides to fight for its people and destroy the evil regime.We know that there are lots of action-adventure indie games around, however, we’re trying really hard to create something special, something that replicates the feeling of the action-adventure games of the 90s while bringing a new edge to it. The atmosphere is of course a great tool for that, but the gameplay is also fundamental. Vengeful Guardian Moonrider is an old-school action platformer, but we tried to make a mix of fast arcade style with a little bit of item hunting and exploration with the Chip System, giving you new abilities and powers during your playthrough. For instance, there are power chips that can grant you double jump, weapon range extension, HP regeneration, and lots of other useful abilities, allowing you to really choose and to play the way you want to.And that wraps it up for this blog post! I hope you’re as excited as us about Vengeful Guardian Moonrider and hope you will enjoy it as much as we’re enjoying making it. Stay tuned for more retro love and keep an eye out for Vengeful Guardian Moonrider, coming to PlayStation.\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDiscover how the siblings have been impacted by the events of the first game and how their gameplay has evolved in the sequel coming on October 18.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHi everyone! Kevin Choteau here, Game Director at Asobo and very excited about everything we’ve been working on to bring you A Plague Tale: Requiem! The game releases on October 18 on PlayStation 5, three years after its prequel, Innocence. So time has passed, and so has it for our two heroes, Amicia and Hugo, who we’ll meet in Requiem six months after we said goodbye to them in Innocence. They’re both children, subject to constant evolution, so you can expect them to have changed! And that’ll impact how you play with them… Let’s look a bit into it right now.Hugo and Amicia have had to evolve a great deal, and to evolve fast to face the trials that life puts in front of them. They’re confronted with the extreme cruelty of their time, and experience atrocities and events that are far bigger than them. So their personalities and their abilities evolve in the process. Amicia learns to fight and to kill, and Hugo learns to use his power. And that does not strictly involve physical skills, it also means to deal with the morality of their actions and the trauma such amount of violence may cause. Following the events of Innocence, Amicia’s more hardened in combat. This is made clear by looking at her new set of weapons, which not only includes an improved version of the sling she was using in Innocence, but also a crossbow—a weapon of war.Hugo was really just a spectator at the start of Innocence, discovering the world and marvelling at everything. But he becomes active as he becomes aware of the danger: he has an extraordinary power that he started using at the end of Innocence, and he continues down that path in Requiem.So our two heroes have matured, and they are prepared for action. But it’s a lot to ask two children, and assuming these roles means developing a sense of darkness. That will be part of how they can use their abilities: weighing their actions and how much darkness they let in will be key to making it through.Learning to control herself will be one of Amicia’s main challenges. Her trauma resurfaces and she has to deal with how far she can go to protect her brother. Her struggle to learn and accept to use force and to kill can lead her to develop a taste for it. Requiem constantly puts her in the position to question the limits of survival and protection instincts. She’s moved past hesitation, but the risk for her to sink completely into violence is real.This internal conflict comes in a context where threats get wilder. In Innocence, the opponents were the Inquisition and English soldiers, quite organised. In Requiem, Amicia and Hugo will face mercenaries and smugglers, more violent and unpredictable. Our team has put a lot of effort into designing their intelligence and reactions to each situation. Their potential of adaptation to Amicia’s moves will truly challenge players!Amicia will need to control this risk of escalation, and that will be made possible by the agency given to players in approaching situations and solving them. The array of tools she can use will broaden, with new alchemical recipes, her improved sling and a crossbow. But more importantly, a whole new spatial dynamic will be introduced.Amicia is going to rely heavily on environment-specific resources and make it her strongest asset. She’s going to develop guerrilla approaches to surprise and harass their opponents, using what is available in the environment to her advantage, from tarpots to slow enemies down to ignitable tall grass. In terms of gameplay, this translates into much more open encounters than what we had in Innocence, fitting the much bigger environments introduced in this new chapter. That means danger can be approached in more than a single way, in a context where there is plenty to explore. You can make up your own mix of alchemy, stealth and action—using a knife in hand-to-to hand combat if it has to come to it! Not only does this allow to avoid escalation if done well, but it allows for the evolution of Amicia and Hugo, from a more vulnerable survival attitude to increasing confidence in facing enemies.Hugo’s supernatural power perfectly represents the duality between their children’s souls and the enormous stakes he and his sister become responsible for. There is a vertiginous dimension brought forth by the rats which is an essential aspect of the game: there’s this gigantic, unstoppable force, it’s scary but it has to be fought to survive.The risk of Hugo losing control while fighting it makes it all the more intimidating. We got to witness it in Innocence, and it becomes an important threat in Requiem. He could destroy a whole city…! We are reaching a scale of threat and awe that wasn’t possible at the time of Innocence.Psychologically too, there’s an important impact to resorting to his powers: Hugo gets to share the perception and the feelings of the rats… Every time he does, it damages him a bit more. That impacts the player’s experience as well and teaches them to be cautious. At the same time, there is a certain vicious pleasure in unleashing this power… but consequences follow and a price is to be paid! It’s a story of moral dilemmas, with the progression of the Macula and the lives of people Hugo holds dear at stake.I hope you’re as excited as me to play Amicia and Hugo’s next chapter! Our team has still so much to share with you in the lead-up to the release, so stay tuned for more! A Plague Tale: Requiem releases on October 18 on PlayStation 5. You can pre-order it now to get exclusive bonuses.\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCrafting a fictional world by representing the best parts of this one.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpeculative fiction often turns the lens back on the reader, making the previously unknown become knowable by turning it into story.It’s long been used as a vehicle for representation, from Star Trek exploring new frontiers of romance, to Octavia Butler positioning a Black woman at the forefront of humanity’s escape to space in Parable of the Sower, to dystopian YA like The Hunger Games tapping into every young woman’s desire to change the world by burning it down.I’m Lindsay Ishihiro, and as the narrative designer of I Was a Teenage Exocolonist, I’d like to tell you about the ways our game follows in this tradition, breaking new ground in how players represent themselves and their gender, sexuality, and relationships in a video game.I Was a Teenage Exocolonist is a genre-spanning game about growing up on an extrasolar colony: part life simulator, deck builder, roleplaying game, and dating simulator. You play Sol, a child whose parents – unhappy with their life on a dying Earth – flung themselves into space intending to create a new human culture from the ground up on the planet Vertumna IV.Given absolute freedom, what do a group of idealists preserve from human cultures, and what do they reject? And what do they accidentally bring with them, despite their best intentions?Exocolonist’s simple character creation system hits far above its weight class. There are only two questions: what are Sol’s pronouns, and will they grow to appear masculine, androgynous, or feminine?Even the UI to select Sol’s appearance is a slider instead of three buttons, giving the player a chance to say their Sol is ‘just a little’ masculine or feminine.They/them is included in the standard pronoun selection, but players who prefer a more bespoke experience can teach it to use their correct pronouns and other gendered terms. In space, anyone can be fae/faeself.You can even change their pronouns and appearance at any time, no gender-changing items or cursed springs required.Sol’s anatomy is set later, during puberty – but there’s even an option for Sol having no reproductive anatomy at all, thanks to futuristic medical technology. Anatomy being separate from appearance and pronouns allows for a huge spectrum of possible genders, encompassing cis bodies, binary and non-binary trans bodies, and gender-nonconforming bodies of many kinds.Even teenage exocolonists have to sit through cringe-inducing lectures in school. Sorry, space teens!Sol wasn’t the only child born in space; nine other children grow up alongside Sol, all of whom (plus one more) are potential friendships and love interests.Let’s get what I consider the bare minimums out of the way: I Was a Teenage Exocolonist is proud to feature transgender and nonbinary characters and includes same-sex, asexual, aromantic, and even polyamorous relationships.With a diverse team, we knew that in order to tell a story about the richness of the human experience we needed to be radically inclusive in our characters and the way they interact with the player and each other.And they do interact with each other! Sol’s friends fall in love, hurt each other, undergo their own tragedies, and even die. Sol is a part of their stories; you choose how important a part you play.Sol becomes closer to their friends by giving them gifts and saying the right things, of course, but also by being the kind of person they’d want to be friends with. Working alongside them, sharing their political opinions, and getting involved in their stories will bring them closer, just like in real life.Also like in real life, friendships can blossom into something different.I Was A Teenage Exocolonist has unique triggers for all relationships. Yes, some still need ten hearts before they’ll give you a kiss, but others are happy to make the space beast with two (and sometimes three) backs while you’re still getting to know each other. Some characters need you to step up at a critical time in their life to feel comfortable opening up to you. Some need to finish their life’s work first. Some naturally prefer to date other people, so getting them interested in Sol requires extra effort.Thanks to the weirdness of the wormhole, Sol will relive their teenage years over and over, learning from their mistakes and helping humanity find its place in the stars. You’ll be many Sols, over many lifetimes.Accurately representing the player in I Was A Teenage Exocolonist is integral to the experience of being Sol, giving them the sense that their unique self is important to humanity as a whole. It was vital to telling a story about finding oneself, literally, at the very forefront of humanity’s most collective action. I Was a Teenage Exocolonist is coming out on PS4 and PS5 on August 25, 2022. Wishlist it today! \n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tZip up your windbreaker and hop on your station wagon - it’s time to cover up crimes to the rhythm of the many music genres of the 1990s, out September 22.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe story of Serial Cleaners begins on New Year’s Eve 1999. Bob and his fellow cleaners, Psycho, Lati, and Vip3r, meet at the back of a funeral home to reminisce about the past. It’s a nostalgic trip to the early 1990s at first, but as recollections continue, strange inaccuracies continue to pile up, exposing long-held truths they have been keeping from each other.Each character has their own story to tell. Your choices throughout the night will slowly alter how they tell that story and ultimately decide how their shared story ends.While keeping its narrative legacy intact, in Serial Cleaners we greatly expand on the ideas of the original game, Serial Cleaner. Instead of presenting the player with simple puzzle-like stages, we decided to present them with a set of tools and abilities to choose from – and improvise. Let your imagination run wild, and you will surely find your own way to cover those pesky crimes!Whether you want to sneak or sprint through the level, drag the evidence around, or cut it to pieces, we have you covered. The game becomes much more open-ended with a wide range of contextual interactions and more involved law enforcement. While the overall complexity increases, the heart of our original game – wiping the scene clean – is still there and feels better than ever.Four different cleaners means four unique perspectives. While Bob relies on his good ol’ tricks of the trade, adjusted and enhanced with the new environment in mind, we bring to the game three new and distinct playstyles. There is Psycho’s brute force, Lati’s agility and awareness, and Vip3r’s cutting-edge tech skills. Each mission is tied to one of the cleaners and unfolds a piece of their turbulent story over the decade.Choosing the ‘90s as our timeframe opened a door into a unique zeitgeist for us. The eccentric Basquiat-esque street art mixed with our fresh spin on cult crime thrillers, Tarantino classics, and B-movie action films allowed us to portray the ‘90s as the decade as it was back then – full of brightly colored optimism… and the grime underneath it all.It’s only natural that all of this should come with a proper soundtrack. There is this crude ‘90s punk nonconformity, the sound of many genres that defined the end of the last century – from East Coast hip-hop, to industrial metal, and a sea of electronic music. From Beastie Boys and Wu-Tang Clan, through Orbital and Prodigy, finishing with Nine Inch Nails and Ministry. Each of the cleaners represents a part of that musical tapestry, which makes their respective music scores uniquely theirs.Such an eclectic aesthetic required someone with a deep-tissue level of understanding of what made the sound of the 1990s what it was. That is why we teamed up with the amazing Joshua Eustis (Telefon Tel Aviv, Nine Inch Nails, Puscifer, and others).What made Joshua’s work really magical was his idea not just to riff on existing well-known tracks, but to try and recreate the ecosystem of musical styles rooted in the subcultures of the 1990s. Styles that were all related and influenced each other in exceptional ways, resulting in a varied, distinct, yet unmistakable aesthetic of the decade – one Josh was uniquely qualified to reproduce since, well, he lived it. Serial Cleaners is a bizarre crime story with a cheeky twist on a wise-guy fantasy. When cleaning up after NYC wrongdoers, you get a glimpse of the sins ingrained in the city’s tissue. But what does it matter? You are a professional, one of the best of the trade. You’re here to solve problems. No matter the case, no matter the cost.Isn’t that right?Serial Cleaners launches on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 on September 22.\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFelicia Day and the Smartest Man Alive, Mimir recap the story thus far in the Myths of Midgard.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGod of War fans were introduced to a new side of Kratos when God of War launched on PS4 in 2018. If you haven’t yet experienced the tale of father and son traveling the realms of Norse myth yourself, or if it’s been a while, we’re ready to catch you up to speed.To prepare for the upcoming release of God of War Ragnarök on November 9, we’ve invited two of the best storytellers we know to recap the journey of Kratos and Atreus from God of War (2018): the amazing Felicia Day and the Smartest Man Alive, Mimir! The new Myths of Midgard video is an animated storybook recounting the events of God of War (2018), with a goal of catching you up on the previous game. Before you watch, beware – there are spoilers ahead! Of course, the best way to experience God of War (2018) is to pick up the Leviathan Axe and leap in yourself (available with PlayStation Extra and Premium membership plans*). You can also pick up the God of War (2018) Digital Deluxe Edition for $9.99 USD during the PlayStation Store Summer Sale through August 17.Hungry for an even deeper summary of God of War (2018)? Keep reading for a full recap.Our story begins with an end, the funeral of Faye – mother to Atreus and wife of Kratos. Her last wish imparted to her family is to scatter her ashes on the highest peak in all the realms. This request begins a journey that forces father and son to work together as they face the dangerous Norse wilds filled with beasts, monsters, and less-than-friendly gods.  Kratos, despite trying to leave his bloody past as the Ghost of Sparta behind, is still haunted by the man – the god – he was. His relationship with Atreus has been distant, stern, and disciplined. Now coping with the death of his wife, Kratos must learn to be the father that his son needs so they can both survive their journey across distant realms to lay Faye to rest.  Atreus is a young boy dealing with the sudden loss of his mother and a cold, distant father. Despite being sickly as a child and only very recently recovering enough to travel, Atreus wants nothing more than to fulfill his mother’s final wish and prove to his father that he is strong. Having been taught by Faye how to use a bow and hunt, Atreus hopes that he can show Kratos he will be an asset on their journey and that he is no longer the frail boy he used to be. After the funeral of Faye, Kratos and Atreus are visited by a mysterious stranger – one who seems intent on picking a fight with the legendary God of War from a distant land. Baldur says he is sent by Odin to investigate the home and its residents, indicating that perhaps he, and the rest of the Norse Gods, are much more aware of Kratos’ past than even his own son. They clash, tearing through the earth and rock surrounding the home in a bloody brawl that reveals Baldur has lost the ability to feel anything – impervious to pain and pleasure alike. Though the battle is close, Kratos is able to harness his rage and finally beats Baldur into submission. While he has rid them of the immediate threat, Kratos realizes that his home, and his son, are no longer safe. They must make the journey now – whether Atreus is ready for it or not. Thinking that they are looking for the highest peak in Midgard, Kratos and Atreus journey towards the tallest mountain in their realm. Along the way they meet the Huldra Brothers, Brok and Sindri, who are renowned dwarven smiths. While the brothers are dealing with some familial tension, both Brok and Sindri provide their assistance and services after seeing that Kratos wields the Leviathan Axe, a weapon they had personally forged for their friend and Kratos’ late wife, Faye. They also encounter the mysterious Witch of the Woods, who offers them her aid including knowledge of how to use the Bifröst, a magical tool that allows father and son to traverse between the Nine Realms. The Witch is later revealed to be the Vanir goddess Freya, mother of Baldur and exiled wife of Odin. As Kratos and Atreus are finally able to reach the peak with Freya’s guidance, they arrive to see Baldur already there, flanked by two hulking accomplices, Magni and Modi – the sons of Thor. They spy the Aesir gods interrogating a man who has been fused to a tree, though they quickly leave after receiving little from the evasive prisoner. Mimir, once an ambassador and advisor to Odin, is the self-described Smarted Man Alive and currently being punished on suspicion of betraying the All-Father. He reveals that while our heroes have made it to the highest peak in Midgard, they have not yet reached the highest peak in all the realms. Their true destination resides in Jötunheim and will, by all accounts, be rather hard to get to considering all entry has been blocked. Mimir knows of another way, but first gives Kratos the pleasure of decapitating him and pleading his case to the Witch of the Woods to magically revive his severed head so he can be free of Odin’s prison.  Finally learning of Freya’s godhood, Kratos distrusts her as he distrusts all of their kind. After reviving Mimir, she advises Kratos to tell Atreus that he is part god, just like his father. Freya warns that denying his son’s true nature will only bring the boy pain. Ignoring her advice – Kratos, Atreus, and the freshly revived Mimir set off to find the tools needed to open a passage to Jötunheim. Along their journey, the trio are ambushed by the two men they saw accompanying Baldur, Magni and Modi. They battle Kratos and Atreus fiercely, though Kratos is able to strike a killing blow on Magni. Modi flees, but later finds the pair again. By killing Kratos, he hopes to regain his honor and prove that he is worthy of Thor’s legacy. Modi subdues Kratos, but seeing his father in peril, Atreus instinctively triggers what appears to be his own Spartan Rage ability.Not knowing his own godhood, Atreus is overwhelmed by the sudden surge and falls unconscious, his childhood illness seemingly returned and worse than ever. Kratos fends off Modi, who quickly departs knowing his life is in danger. Seeing that Atreus is barely alive, Kratos takes his son to Freya in the hopes her magic can help save his son.   Freya reveals that Atreus’ sickness is caused due to the conflict between his nature as a god and his ignorance of that fact. She believes she has a treatment that can wake him but requires the heart of a creature in Helheim, the realm of the dead.Knowing the frost-attuned Leviathan Axe will be of little help to him in the frozen wastelands of Hel, Kratos returns to his home and retrieves a part of his past he had hoped to leave behind – the Blades of Chaos. The Blades were once a tool of fiery bloodshed and a symbol of Kratos’ servitude to the Greek gods, many of which he killed in his life as the God of War. Knowing they are the key to saving his son, Kratos chooses to acknowledge his past for the sake of saving Atreus and equips the Blades of Chaos once again. Kratos successfully retrieves the heart for Freya, allowing her to save his son. After he regains consciousness, Kratos reveals to Atreus their true nature as gods. Despite Atreus’ illness fading with this secret now in the open, the boy grows increasingly arrogant. Modi finds the pair again, desperate to try and finish them off to regain a scrap of respect from Thor. Badly beaten by his father for failing to kill Kratos and letting his brother Magnai die, Modi proves to be little threat. Atreus stabs the weakened Modi in direct defiance of Kratos’ order, killing the god once and for all. Seeing that Atreus’ newly revealed godhood has caused his son to become increasingly cruel and arrogant, Kratos knows he must teach his son to be better before it’s too late. Having gathered the tools to make a portal to Jötunheim, Kratos, Atreus, and Mimir return once again to the peak of Midgard to travel to the realm of the Giants. As they arrive, they are ambushed by Baldur. Instead of following his father’s directions and jumping through the just-opened portal, Atreus, in his arrogance, tries to fight Baldur alone. Kratos intervenes, but during his clash with Baldur, the portal to Jötunheim is destroyed. Baldur incapacitates and captures Atreus when the boy tries to attack him single-handedly again and takes off towards the Lake of Nine. Kratos follows, their battle eventually leads to the Realm Travel Room, where Baldur attempts to take them to Asgard. At the last moment, Kratos diverts the Bifröst to another realm instead, Helheim. In the realm of the dead, they are faced with specters of not just Kratos’ past, but Baldur’s as well. While father and son overcome the trials of this frozen realm, they discover the source of Baldur’s invulnerability was a spell cast by his mother.At the time of his birth, Freya had learned that her son was fated to be killed. To prevent any harm coming to Baldur, she casts a spell to protect him from all magical and physical threats. Despite Freya’s mastery of the art, Vanir magic is notoriously slippery and hard to control. The spell had a single weakness she could not prevent, Baldur would not be impervious to mistletoe. As Baldur grew, the effects of the spell became clear. While the god was invulnerable to everything, it also rendered him completely numb – unable to feel pain, and all of life’s pleasures too. Even though he begged Freya to undo the spell, she would not for fear of the prophecy coming true and her son dying. Baldur grew to hate and resent his mother for denying him the ability to feel. After Baldur’s relationship with Freya and the truth of his condition is revealed, Kratos and Atreus escape back to Midgard having reconciled and made amends to each other following the events of Modi’s death and Baldur’s attack. After the destruction of the portal to Jötunheim, Mimir shares one last solution: they can try to get to the realm of the Giants. Before they can attempt it, Kratos and Atreus are attacked again by Baldur who also escaped Helheim, but this time Freya intervenes. Incensed by his mother’s arrival, Baldur seeks to kill not only Kratos and Atreus, but finally exact revenge on his mother for the spell placed on him at birth. Having worked together over the entire journey across the realms, father and son now fight in unison. Together they push back Baldur, only to see Freya once again try to stop the fighting by subduing Kratos. As Baldur moves to strike a finishing blow, Atreus protects his father, placing himself between them which causes the Aesir god to punch the mistletoe arrowhead Atreus kept as a binding for his quiver. With the arrowhead impaled through his hand, the spell finally breaks and Baldur, for the first time in his life, is finally able to feel everything – the pain of an injury, the cold snow below his feet, the sun on his face. Reveling in the new sensations, Baldur recommences his attack with a mad vigor – relishing in all the feelings he had never been able to experience before. They fight again, but through their shared strength, Kratos and Atreus are finally able to beat the newly vulnerable Baldur, who demands they kill him and end his life while he is still able to feel. Freya pleads with them to spare her only son, and Kratos relents – knowing all too well the pain a parent feels at losing a child. As they turn to leave, Baldur uses his remaining strength to try and strangle Freya as payment for his years of numb torment. Freya accepts her death, hoping it will give her son some semblance of peace in his life to know she’s gone. Kratos, seeing his own bloody mistakes about to be repeated by Baldur, steps in to save Freya’s life by killing her son. Unable to accept his death, Freya cradles the dead body of Baldur while swearing vengeance upon Kratos for taking away her only child, even if it meant that she would live. Finally able to make the journey to Jötunheim with the help of Mimir’s Bifröst eyes, Kratos and Atreus reach a Giant temple – one that has their entire journey carved into the walls. The Giants had seen what would come to pass, as well as what had come before. They discover that this was all left for them by Faye, who was a Giant herself – a secret she had kept from her husband and son. Atreus finally uncovers the full truth of his heritage, that he is not only part god and part mortal, he is part Giant as well. Atreus had two names, one was given to him by his father and the other, his mother. The name Faye had bestowed upon him was Loki. Together Kratos and Atreus scatter the ashes on the peak of Jötunheim, finally fulfilling their quest. As they return home to Midgard, Mimir warns them that the death of Baldur means that the first event said to mark the arrival of Ragnarök has come to pass.  Kratos and Atreus now find themselves at the center of a prophecy that has foretold the complete upheaval of the Nine Realms and a battle so great it results in the deaths of many Aesir gods including Odin and Thor. Father and son will have to choose their path as the freezing winds and snows of Fimbulwinter envelop their home in Midgard.  —– Discover the rest of the story yourself when God of War Ragnarök launches on PS5 and PS4 November 9, 2022.For the latest updates around God of War Ragnarök, make sure you follow Santa Monica Studio on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.*Game library varies over time, region/country and plan.

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Brand new spiritual sequel to fan-favorite remake Battle For Bikini Bottom: Rehydrated. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAre you ready, kids? SpongeBob returns to the screen in a new fantastic adventure! SpongeBob and Patrick are traveling to a multitude of different Wishworlds, each with its very own setting and rules, like the Wild West Jellyfish Fields or the Halloween Rock Bottom. On the THQ Nordic Showcase we just revealed gameplay for the first time.What was the elevator pitch for the game?Let’s create a brand new spiritual sequel to our fan-favorite remake Battle For Bikini Bottom: Rehydrated. A 3D platformer focused on themed worlds, funky costumes and the buddy banter between SpongeBob and Patrick. Focusing on SpongeBob, as he travels the Wild West, medieval or prehistoric times and more, was always at the core of the game vision. And the idea of having Patrick be your constant companion, in the form of a cute Balloon, was also there right from the very beginning.Was it always certain a sequel was on the cards?  Greenlighting a new project in the world of SpongeBob is a collaborative process with our very supportive friends at Nickelodeon, who know the franchise in and out and make the final call. Ultimately the success of Battle for Bikini Bottom: Rehydrated, and the passionate support of its fans is what allowed us to send SpongeBob and Patrick on another great adventure!   How does the game evolve or change the gameplay from the previous title?  Battle For Bikini Bottom had three playable characters: SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy. Each with one or more special abilities. For The Cosmic Shake we decided to focus on SpongeBob and giving him a lot of new abilities, like a flying karate kick or being able to roll around on big rocks. Unlocking dozens of cult classic costumes for SpongeBob is also for the first time a core focus in a SpongeBob game. Whether you want to run around as a knight in shiny armor or just in your underpants: it’s up to you!And last but not least, the themed worlds. SpongeBob inadvertently messes with the very fabric of the universe, when playing with a vial of wish-fulfilling Mermaid’s Tears. As a result Patrick is turned into a balloon, and our heroes have to travel to weird Wishworlds to bring back their friends and restore Bikini Bottom. Whether it’s bringing back Sandy from a karate-movie themed Downtown Bikini Bottom or rescuing Pearl from the medieval Sulfur Fields… every world is unique and has its own distinct story.     Can you describe the gameplay levels that you can see in the showcase trailer?In the trailer you get a first look at multiple worlds that SpongeBob and Patrick travel to in the game. It starts with the boss fight against a giant Gary in Halloween Rock Bottom. Then we join our heroes searching for Squidward in the Prehistoric Kelp Forest. That leads us straight into some funky kah-rah-tay action in Downtown Bikini Bottom. And finally we get a first glimpse at the Wild West Jellyfish Fields.We hope you enjoyed these Embark on this brand-new 3D platformer, coming to PlayStation 4 and playable on PlayStation 5.\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReimagining of the classic survival horror is coming to PlayStation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExperience the franchise that defined the survival-horror genre and pathed the way for classics like Resident Evil and Silent Hill – yes, we’re delighted to let you know that the reimagining of Alone in the Dark is coming to PlayStation 5! A technical marvel when it first launched in 1992, Alone in the Dark set the standards for immersive horror adventures to come. Developer Pieces Interactive is returning to the franchise’s roots in terms of setting while updating and reimagining the game for a new generation of players.You can get a feel for what’s in store in our haunting new trailer. Hold your nerve as viewer discretion is very, very advised…  To do justice to such a seminal title in video game history, we’re proud to say there is a stellar lineup of talent involved. Developers Pieces Interactive is a mix of hot new talent and seasoned veteran developers. An engaging story has been created by Mikael Hedberg, cult horror writer of SOMA and Amnesia: The Dark Descent, some of the most acclaimed narrative horror experiences of the last decade. Legendary Guillermo del Toro collaborator, Guy Davis, has contributed monster designs. And Doom Jazz legend Jason Köhnen provides eerie and haunting melodies to create a tense, twisted and haunting audio atmosphere. In Alone in the Dark, you’ll experience a completely original story, but it does incorporate characters, places, and themes from the original ’90s trilogy. No prior knowledge of the original titles is required to enjoy the game, but fans of the series will find plenty that is familiar.Our Alone in the Dark is set in the gothic American south during the 1920s – a noir setting with classic Lovecraftian horror elements. It’s a world where the familiar meets the surreal. You’ll revisit an expanded and transformed Derceto Mansion, the location that featured in the 1992 game, and various other sites connected to Derceto too. Both Emily Hartwood and Edward Carnby, the original game’s protagonists, are playable, but all enemies are new, original creations. Although there are some nods to monsters from the past… The game features classic survival horror gameplay, as you’d expect. You’ll explore environments, solve puzzles, and experience a deep psychological original horror story. You’ll also experience hyper-tense action and combat as you battle supernatural monsters. We aim to create a game that takes advantage of modern gaming technology to reimagine so much of what makes the original great while pushing things forward for a new Alone in the Dark experience on PlayStation 5. We can’t wait to reveal more. \n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Nixxes discusses the technical and artistic process of adding ultra-wide support \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHi everyone, I’m Julian Huijbregts, Community Manager at Nixxes. Today we celebrate the launch of Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered on PC!In the past year, our team has been working closely together with our friends at Insomniac Games to bring this original Marvel story and PlayStation hit to PC. To give you more insight into the support for ultra-wide monitors and multiple screen setups*, I’d like to introduce you to some of the members of our Nixxes team.Graphics Programmer Hilze Vonck, a passionate ultra-wide screen gamer himself, worked on the technical implementation of ultra-wide aspect ratios in the PC version of Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered. “For five years I have used a 21:9 ultra-wide monitor. To me support for ultra-wide resolutions in games is really important. We want to give gamers who invest a lot in their setups the opportunity to play the game in the best way possible. It really makes a big difference when you see the game on ultra-wide or triple monitor setups. It is super cool to experience the game in this way!”Lead Software Engineer Coen Frauenfelder explains that one of the reasons to go all-out with ultra-wide monitor support was the positive feedback from the gaming community on 21:9 support in other PC games. “We initially planned support for 21:9, and after some internal tests we decided to go even wider and add support for 32:9 screens and 48:9 for triple monitor setups. The game lends itself very well for that. Swinging through the streets of Marvel’s New York on an ultra-wide screen gives a whole different and more immersive feeling.”The PC version of Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered is fully optimized for ultra-wide gaming. Not only the gameplay, but also the many cut scenes are adapted for panoramic aspect ratios up to 32:9. Coen talks about the challenges that Nixxes had to overcome, to make this possible:“Implementing ultra-wide support in general gameplay is relatively easy. The big challenge is supporting it in cinematics that are specifically designed by artists to be viewed on 16:9 screens. Outside of that view area, lots of things are happening that need to be fixed. Characters can for example freeze or suddenly disappear. The easy way would be to place black borders in cut scenes to block these areas from view on ultra-wide screens, but we wanted to give PC gamers the possibility to fully use their screens. Our QA team meticulously went through all the cut scenes in ultra-wide view and listed all the details that had to be changed by our engineers and artists.”Coen emphasizes how hard it was to get all of that right: “We knew it would take a lot of effort to pull off, but our team was passionate and committed to get the most out of it. Hilze’s enthusiasm towards it meant he got to work a lot on the technical aspects of implementing ultra-wide support.”As a result, cinematics in Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered on PC are fully viewable in aspect ratios up to 32:9. When using even wider aspect ratios, for example with triple monitor setups, the outer edges are blurred during cut scenes. This is necessary to block areas from view that otherwise may have visual errors. Apart from his work on the engine for ultra-wide support, Hilze also worked on this: “That was not an easy feature to implement. It took a while, but I think it looks really great.”Outside of gameplay and cinematics, system engineers at Nixxes made sure that the user interface and menus support wide-screen aspect ratios. When using ultra-wide monitors, you can change the position of the HUD to different positions.We know that not all of you have ultra-wide screens or multiple monitor setups. On traditional 16:9 screens the PC version of Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered also offers many enhancements. The game features enhanced ray-traced reflections**, supports NVIDIA DLSS and other upscaling technologies, and offers a full suite of customizable rendering settings.Everyone at Nixxes has been incredibly excited to work on this project together with our friends at Insomniac. We would love to hear about your experiences playing the Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered on PC. Reach out to us on Twitter and follow us to stay up to date!Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered for PC is available today on Steam and in the Epic Games Store.*Compatible PC and display device required.**Compatible PC required.\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMaster Kara’s arsenal and tap into Super Reflex Time to win top prize in the thrilling bloodsport.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRollerdrome is a fast-paced bloodsport which will have you balancing gnarly skate tricks with high-powered firefights against the deadly House Players. To help you achieve maximum impact when you enter the Arena on August 16, I spoke to some of the devs who helped build the game and got the lowdown on the combat system. There are four types of weapons in Rollerdrome, which you’ll unlock throughout the game:Combos are achieved by eliminating enemies in quick succession. Swapping back and forth between weapons allows you to capitalize on the benefits of multiple weapons while maintaining a combo. Try blowing the doors off a Mecha Brut with a well-placed grenade before closing in and finishing it off with the shotgun. You can also shoot your own grenade with the pistols, ensuring it detonates near a specific enemy. You can even use the detonation to change direction mid-air, though you will also take damage – so use this technique sparingly! Use Slug Shots to stun-lock enemies, and then finish them up with a quick barrage from the pistols before they have time to teleport away or shield up.And remember: it’s not just your own weapons at your disposal. A savvy player will be able to press enemies into using their attacks against each other (or even themselves).One of the key mechanics you’ll need to utilize in Rollerdrome is Reflex Time. You can access Reflex Time by pressing L2 – but use this carefully, as Reflex Time only lasts for a few moments before needing to recharge. In Reflex Time, you’ll experience a brief moment of slo-mo gameplay, which is a great opportunity to use the rapid-fire pistols and stun-lock your enemies. In Super Reflex Time (which you can access by perfect dodging just before you enter Reflex Time), you get a noticeable power boost – this is a great time to use pistols at short range, or the Z-11 for further away foes. While most of the time you’ll access Super Reflex Time by dodging enemy attacks, you can also trigger it by dodging through your own grenade launcher’s explosions – enabling you to activate it on your own terms, without waiting for the enemies to attack.Out of ammo? It’s time to do some tricks. In Rollerdrome, ammo is acquired by performing skate tricks, so you’ll need to focus on that as well as on taking out your enemies. The best bang for your buck comes from mixing up and chaining together tricks – you can do this by stringing tricks together with wallrides, grinds, and grabs. Try using Reflex Time while in the air mid-trick to get a good scope on an enemy and take them out in style. Using a variety of tricks, rather than just the same ones over and over, is key to getting maximum ammo, so brush up on a bunch of different styles and make use of them wherever you can. If balancing keeping your combo up and taking out enemies at the same time is proving tricky, you can also grab the floating yellow Combo Tokens to keep your combo going while you pull off a few quick tricks for a bit more ammo. Then it’s time to eliminate your enemies and emerge victorious.Rollerdrome is available August 16 on PS4 and PS5.Huge thanks to our amazing devs Bartosz Rakowski (consultant), Dan Gronner (lead QA tester), David Jenkins (head of QA), and Jacob Mills (senior 3D level designer), who offered their advice and insight for this article.\n",

More info How Capcom designed Kimberly and Juri for Street Fighter 6\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe developer dives into character design details for the newly announced fighters.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFresh off the streets of Evo 2022, two more characters have been announced for Street Fighter 6, the next evolution of the Street Fighter franchise, launching in 2023. Juri returns with her playfully sadistic ways along with new ninja Kimberly! We sat down with Game Director Takayuki Nakayama to ask him how Kimberly and Juri were designed along with quick bios for the duo. Bust out some beats and shake up your spray cans to welcome the newest ninja to Street Fighter 6. Kimberly invited herself to become Guy’s student, who is the 39th Successor to Bushinryu after defeating his master Zeku, the 38th Successor. Kimberly had an ordinary upbringing, but she’s a prodigy who graduated college early and now wants to be a full-fledged ninja. She is infatuated with ’80s pop culture when the portable cassette player was at its peak popularity, hence why she always carries one with her.Takayuki Nakayama: In terms of Kimberly’s design, we aimed to create an outfit suitable for her speedy and acrobatic movements since she excels in sports like track-and-field and cheerleading. Pair her brightly colored gi with sneakers suitable for moving around quickly, and you have Bushinryu-like ninja attire, don’t you think? We tried to make her hairstyle and outfit beautifully showcase her striking silhouette since she is an expert at running and airborne attacks. The spray can and portable cassette player on her waist are also used for special moves.The music she listens to originates from a certain person, but you will have to wait for the story to find out who that is. Let’s see how Kimberly, the Ninja + Pop Star = Ninja Star, performs. 　According to Nakayama, Kimberly’s arsenal of techniques make use of her high physical strength and allows her to open up opponents in various ways. Being a spunky new ninja, Kimberly incorporates an urban twist to reimagine what Bushinryu means to her. She uses Genius at Play to stock up on a spray can, which can then be thrown to the ground as a Shuriken Bomb. During Hidden Variable, Kimberly conceals herself in colorful smoke before instantly appearing in front of an opponent for a surprise attack. Finally, she has the trademark ninja Sprint, which can be followed up with kick options or Arc Step where Kimberly launches herself off from the opponent.First appearing in Super Street Fighter IV, Juri remains a sadistic thrillseeker who enjoys the suffering of others, taking immense joy in obliterating her foes. Previously, her main motivator was revenge against M. Bison, but since his fall in Street Fighter V, she now whittles away her time in a gloomy haze. What lies in store for her now?Takayuki Nakayama: For Juri, this costume retains the image from her Super Street Fighter IV one, but has been rearranged to fit the Street Fighter 6 aesthetic. There is also a change in the hairstyle, which I think gives it extra personality.Underneath her jacket, black tape that imitates the appearance of a spider covers her body. The colors of her Feng Shui Engine are purple, black, and white, and accented with emerald green. Also, please pay attention to her helmet, as you may have seen in the trailer when she appears on her motorcycle, since it matches her design. Her smart phone also reflects her personality and style, don’t you think?Fans of Juri will be wickedly pleased to know she retains many of her past moves with different properties now. Fuhajin returns where Juri performs an upwards kick and stores Fuha stocks upon completion. Saihasho, Ankensatsu, and Go Ohsatsu are newly named special moves, but may be visually familiar in the form of the low projectile or jumping axe kick. While these can now be performed without having to expend Fuha stocks, they can be chained together and powered up if a Fuha stock is available.Finally, Juri’s Shiku-sen, a flying dive kick, returns from Super Street Fighter IV, which can be followed up with a series of flashy airborne kicks. This opens up more creative options for Juri’s playstyle and can catch an opponent off guard. If you missed it, Street Fighter 6 has a new Real Time Commentary Feature where notable names in the fighting game community lend their voices to commentate your matches. Previously, Vicious and Aru were revealed to be the first two Play-by-Play Commentators back in June. Now, we can confirm two more legendary commentators. First, we want to go into more detail on the Real Time Commentary Feature. In tournaments, there are usually two commentators working in tandem: the Play-by-Play Commentator, who specializes in describing the action with articulate and rapid delivery, and the Color Commentator, who gives further insight and analysis into the match. We mirror this concept in Street Fighter 6 where you can select both a Play-by-Play Commentator and a Color Commentator in the settings!Joining Vicious and Aru as a Play-by-Play Commentator is Tasty Steve, who brings his trademark energy, charisma, and hype to his performance. Our first Color Commentator reveal is no other than the fighting game historian, James Chen. We’re honored to have these two legends be a part of Street Fighter 6 history and can’t wait for you to hear them in-game. We’ll reveal more voices in the future!This completes our Evo 2022 announcements. We’re excited to have Kimberly and Juri bring their unique personalities to the character roster while James Chen and Tasty Steve lend their voices to Street Fighter 6. We’ll see you later in the year for our next reveals! Any guesses?\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSoundtrack creator Electric Dragon shares his thoughts on developing a new sound for the dark retro-future in Rollerdrome, out August 16.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRoll7’s upcoming skater-shooter, Rollerdrome, features a fully original soundtrack, featuring dark retro-futuristic synth beats by the incredible Electric Dragon. I spoke to Ian, the artist behind Electric Dragon, to discuss the process of working on the project and creating this all-new album.Jemima Tyssen Smith: Hello Ian! I had the pleasure of working with you while you created the incredible all-new music for Rollerdrome. This was such an exciting project for Roll7. What was it that drew you to the project?Electric Dragon: You summoned me!Haha – it’s true! Yes, I was actually the first person to reach out to you – we initially wanted just the one track, right?Yes, that’s just it – I didn’t know the full details of the game at the time, but what I saw was super interesting to me, and I actually offered to do some original work at that point. After that I had a meeting with some of the team and we talked through what was needed in more detail. I’d been in a rut with the album I was working on, and talking to the folks at Roll7 really gave me a burst of inspiration. I think it just all came together really well for everyone involved, actually. I’d always wanted to work on a game soundtrack, and Rollerdrome is an incredible game to be involved with.I think when you spoke about the possibility of original tracks that felt perfect for us since we wanted such a specific vibe to the soundtrack. Could you talk a bit about that?Yeah, so the energy we were after was a soundtrack with the power of synthwave but a distinct 70’s flavour. It felt like it might be quite tricky to balance as we really wanted to avoid going too disco as well – the game has a darkness to it that needed to be echoed in the music. In the end it actually came together quite naturally, though. I basically tackled the soundtrack as if it was sort of from the angle of the 70’s looking forward – very BBC ‘Tomorrow’s World’, you know? And then I was inspired a bit by lots of different things really: 70’s pioneers like Vangellis, Wendy Carlos, Philip Glass, Giorgio Moroder, Tangerine Dream… lots of inspiration from lots of places!Seeing all of the cool kit you have is so inspiring – it’s all really interesting stuff. What was it that drew you to music and to synthwave in the first place?I used to have a Commodore 64 as a kid, and my uncle bought me some software for that which was called ‘Utilisynth’. It was very complicated, but I managed to make some awesome wibbly-wobbly noises, and from there on I was sort of hooked! I went on to play guitar, I DJ’d house music in the 90’s, I was even in a death metal band for a bit… but in time I returned to synth.And we’re very glad you did! This project is obviously quite different to working on an album that’s not attached so closely to a game and a concept – how did that work for you?Yeah, since the tracks need to fit with the gameplay I couldn’t really do breakdowns in the same way I might have done on a totally free-form album, so that was a really interesting challenge to work around. I also needed to strike a balance between the dystopian narrative and the thrilling gameplay – the tracks needed grit, but they also needed a sense of fun in there, too. I think those moments of positivity really help make the dark parts of the game darker, which I really like. One thing I did love about the process – and this might seem silly – is that the narrative really helped me to pick track titles. I always find naming tracks a bit tough, so it was a real relief to have content already there to pull titles from!Lastly, I have to ask – where does the name ‘Electric Dragon’ come from?It’s from a 2001 Japanese film – Electric Dragon 80.000 V. It’s about two rivals who get electrocuted and then end up with superpowers… and they also play seriously guitar-wrecking solos.That sounds so cool! I’m adding it to my watch list as we speak. Thank you so much for taking the time to chat to me today and for making this epic soundtrack. I just can’t wait for people to experience it in-game.Me neither!Rollerdrome is coming to PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 August 16.\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCreators sound off on the unique title choice, plus reveal new screenshots of absurd goat action.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHi PlayStation players! Exciting news straight from the goat’s mouth, Goat Simulator 3 has a launch date! Pilgor and friends will be crashing onto PlayStation 5 November 17. We’ve heard that a lot of people are getting confused by the naming of our game, Goat Simulator 3. Here at Coffee Stain Publishing we wanted to set the record straight and answer the question of why it’s called Goat Simulator “3”… Unfortunately we’ve not managed to get a straight answer from our friends over at Coffee Stain North, the creators of the game. Which isn’t totally surprising as they are a bit of a strange bunch.But in the spirit of transparency and since you asked, here’s what we were told by various members of the team, we’ll let you decide what to think.  What we do know is that Goat Simulator 3 is officially coming out on November 17 and you can pre-order the standard edition now on PlayStation 5 here for a jiggly ‘pre-udder’ surprise or pick the Digital Downgrade Edition which comes with a selection of remastered items from Goat Simulator. We’ve also revealed a special collector’s Goat In A Box Edition (currently available for pre-order in EU and ANZ regions only) for the ultimate goat enthusiasts. Pre-order now and you’ll get your own little Pilgor toy to cuddle or keep in pristine condition in the attic and hope it will become valuable someday (Warning: It won’t).Sorry again for the lack of clarity, to make up for it we’ve got a couple of new exclusive screenshots from the game in the hopes that you’ll forgive us <3Aggressively assert your own personal style, whatever the occasion.When you feel the need – the need for speed, Goat Simulator 3 has you covered.\n",

More info The realism of FIFA 23’s new motion capture technology\n",
      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFIFA 23’s HyperMotion 2 motion capture system allows the game to be more true-to-life than ever.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFIFA 23 is on the way, and EA is not only looking to make it the most expansive title of the series to date but the most realistic as well. To do this, EA has upgraded its HyperMotion motion capture system to HyperMotion 2 and improved its machine learning algorithm. Both tools capture and put together data to make virtual football as authentic as possible. Said data even comes from actual football matches by the team in Zaragoza, Spain, shot on Xsens technology. All this works together to create the most visually authentic entry in the series thus far.FIFA 23 utilizes Advanced 11-v-11 match capture, meaning that actual football players came together for full-on matches using Xsens suits. This year’s game draws from two matches featuring professional teams, including a women’s match (a series first). That capture was then combined with EA’s new machine learning algorithm to make players and the environments around them more lifelike.Various visual and mechanical enhancements further amplify FIFA 23’s faithfulness to the sport. Players’ limbs now react to the impact of the ball, and fully-3D nets even move when the ball or players make contact with them. Other extra touches like new animations and (over 500) chants for crowds liven up a match’s physical and emotional energy. HyperMotion 2 and the new machine learning algorithm have a hand in various innovations coming to FIFA 23’s gameplay. EA presented several features made possible thanks to this innovative technology. Full Team Authentic Motion ensures that no two plays are identical. Star-specific run styles, improved technical dribbling, female athlete-specific animations, and left-footed skill moves are now made possible with these advancements. Now more than ever, football matches look and feel more like they do in real life. More detailed and more authentic animations lead to more depth and control in the game itself.  For example, Power Shots are a new skill-based risk-reward mechanic that unlocks yet another layer of strategy. To use them, you must carve out the perfect space and aim precisely, pressing L1 and R1, then shoot to activate. If performed correctly, you can score goals with more power and accuracy. However, the longer animations and the need for precision introduce a higher risk.Defensive areas of the game aren’t left out either. You can lie down behind the wall to block low shots. The new motion capture data also allows players to perform clearance slide, physical, and back heel tackles, which aggressively counter offensive abilities, such as added shooting types like chesting, backspins, and downward volleys. There are even more ways to pass, including the always smile-inducing bum bumping. EA is aiming for authenticity with FIFA 23, and every piece of the game is building toward that goal. You can experience this true-to-life football title when it releases on PlayStation 4 and 5 on September 30.\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThree new legendary cars are added, including the Nissan Skyline Super Silhouette Group 5 ‘84.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGran Turismo players! The July update for Gran Turismo 7 arrives today July 27 at 11:00pm PDT* (June 27 at 7am BST / 3pm JST). An extraordinary Skyline that stood out in races of the 1980’s.The Skyline Super Silhouette is one of the most iconic cars from this series, with a look that is far from ordinary to say the least. Sporting a chin spoiler that extends far forward of the car almost scraping the tarmac, fenders expanded to extreme levels in both the front and rear, combined with a large rear wing, it was powered by a 2.1 litre 4 cylinder turbocharged racing engine called the LZ20B. Often spitting flames out of its exhaust located just below the left hand door, it was an incredible presence on the track that completely mesmerized car enthusiasts and race fans of its day.A beautiful streamlined 2-seater sportscar that won the Gran Turismo Trophy.Every August in the U.S., the most beautiful cars from throughout all of car history are gathered for the world famous Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance. The 2014 winner of the Gran Turismo Trophy, just one of the awards available, was this Maserati A6GCS/53 Spyder, chassis No. 2078. The A6 was the designation for a series of 6-cyclinder racing cars developed by Maserati from 1947 to 1956. The GCS, intended for sports car championship competition, started out resembling a 2-seater version of the classic cigar shaped grand prix cars. However, after regulations changed in 1953, a number of coachbuilders began to fashion their own designs for the tubular frame.This super sports car is a reinterpretation of the glorious Carrera GT as a plug-in hybrid.The Porsche 918 Spyder is a supercar introduced by Porsche in 2011. A successor to the Carrera GT, production was limited to 918 cars. The most notable aspect of the car is that it is actually a plug-in hybrid. A 599 BHP 4.6L V8 engine based on the engine from the RS Spyder prototype race car is mounted in the mid-ship position with a single electric motor in the rear, resulting in a total system output of 873 BHP. This incredible performance when combined with the optional Weissach Package allows the car to reach 62.1 mph in 2.6s, 124.3 mph in 7.2s and 186.4 mph in just 19.9s. Advertised as having a top speed of 214.4 mph, it was able to set a lap time of 6:57 on the Nürburgring Nordschleife.Be sure to stay tuned to official GT and PlayStation channels as there are plenty more updates to come from the team. Until then, happy racing!* Internet connection required for update. Game progression required to access vehicles.\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Check out the new see-through view and broadcasting option for PS VR2.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe road to launch for PlayStation VR2 is in full swing, and we can’t wait for you to try the exciting new games and experiences you’ll be able to explore with our next-generation virtual reality headset.  As we continue with our launch efforts, today, we’d like to offer a quick peek at some of the user experience features you’ll discover on PS VR2. Let’s take a look. With PS VR2, you can see your surroundings while wearing the headset with our new see-through feature. It comes in handy when you want to easily check where the PS VR2 Sense controllers are in your room without taking the headset off. Thanks to PS VR2’s embedded front cameras, users can press the function button on the headset, or use the Card in the Control Center, to switch between viewing your surroundings, or viewing the content on PS VR2. The Card in the Control Center also gives quick access to other PS VR2 settings, such as adjusting your play area.The see-through view is just for viewing only, so there’s no recording option.A new broadcast feature for PS VR2 will allow you to film yourself while playing, by connecting a PS5 HD Camera to the console. It’s a great way to show your movements and reactions during a boss battle and share your reactions with your fellow gamers as it happens! The play area for PS VR2 can be customized by using the PS VR2 Sense controllers and the embedded cameras. The cameras will allow you to scan the room, while the PS VR2 Sense controllers allow you to expand and further customize the play area to fit your play style and room environment.While playing, if you get close to the boundary you have set up, you will receive a warning that you are closely approaching the play area boundary. You can modify your settings at any time while PS VR2 is connected. Once you set up your play area, the settings will be saved unless you move into a different play area.In VR Mode, players can enjoy VR game content in a 360 view in a virtual environment. Content will be displayed in 4000 x 2040 HDR video format (2000 x 2040 per eye) with 90Hz/120Hz frame rate.In Cinematic Mode, players can view the PS5 system and UI and all non-VR game and media content on a virtual cinema screen. Content in Cinematic Mode will be displayed in 1920×1080 HDR video format with 24/60Hz and also 120Hz frame rate.PS VR2 game developers will begin to access the latest user experience for PS VR2 in a new system software release coming soon as part of the ongoing development. There are lots of exciting things to look forward to for PS VR2, and we can’t wait to share more details about our next-generation virtual reality headset that takes a dramatic leap forward in gameplay innovation. We’ll share more information soon, including launch date and additional games coming to the platform.  Design and specification within the images are subject to change without notice.\n",

Can't see it on the storeInterested in Saints Row but I am waiting for the reviews.Even though it's a bit more grounded than the most recent in the franchise it still looks like it will be a lot of silly not taking itself too seriously gaming fun.I just want to know there are no big technical or performance problems before I pull the trigger.Bleep! Soul Hackers 2 is going to be here already!?I’m not even done with Xenoblade 2 before I could start XC3…. too much JRPG goodness in my backlog….@BBB saw a Reddit post from someone who got the game early so I asked if the plot revolves around a bunch of hipster students that want to pay back their student loans & he said it does 👎🏻Really hope Saints row is good - I need a GTA style open world fix. Waiting for the reviews, but if it gets 75 or higher on Metacritic I’ll probably bite.

Hosted by 44 Bytes.Who's Your Daddy?! Is Still One Of Xbox's Most Popular GamesGuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpSeriouslyBack at the start of the year, we reported on a new Xbox game called \"Who's Your Daddy?!\" that launched into the Xbox Game Preview program at the low, low price of £4.19 / $4.99. Eight months later, that game is amazingly still finding its way to the top of the \"Top Paid Xbox Games\" charts on the Microsoft Store.The premise of the game is that you play as either a Daddy or a Baby - the Daddy's job is to try and prevent the baby from getting into any harm, while the Baby's job is the exact opposite! Here's the official description:Who's Your Daddy?! is a casual asymmetric multiplayer game featuring a clueless father attempting to prevent his infant son from certain death. Play with up to 7 of your friends online (up to 4 player split-screen), and test your parenting skills in a competitive setup with wacky physics and over 67 potentially ominous household items.At the time of writing, it's clocked up just over 2100 reviews on the Xbox Store with an average of 4/5 stars, so it's certainly proving a hit, and the actual full release isn't even expected to take place until December of this year.If you're interested, there's a free trial on the Xbox Store, so maybe give it a go!Have you played Who's Your Daddy?!

But, what about some of those racers that have fallen by the wayside in recent times, like Burnout and Need for Speed?Some entries in those two franchises are still held in very high regard, even many, many years after release. Then, there are a number of racing games that simply flew under the radar, like cult favourites Blur and Split/Second.So, we want to know what your favourite racing series on Xbox is. Any era, any style, which of these would you pick?If your beloved racer isn't here, drop it down in the comments!About Ben KerryBen is a fan of action, racing and straight-up shootin' in any video game he can get his hands on. When he's not gaming, Ben spends his time listening to way too much Guns N' Roses, watching football and probably eating somewhere.Comments (31)PGR4 is my all time favourite racing game.Forza Horizon. I rest my case. Made me realise how utterly boring Gran Turismo is.Project Gotham 3 and 4 for me with the Forza horizon series a close 2nd never could get into forza motorsport though. Split second on xbox 360 was amazing too.Dirt rally 2.0 is as close to perfection as racing games have come for me, so DiRT gets my vote..No Rallisport Challenge? For shame!Too hard for me as a racing games fan. Split/Second, FlatOut Ultimate Carnage, TDU, PGR... How do I even choose? Going with Forza feels... Basic?So many great racing series on the list, I chose Burnout since I used to play those games all the time.Yes FH winning buy a long shot. So well deserved. Come this November 2022 still the only true top end AAA exclusive title on the series consoles to have released from an Xbox studio. Which on another note is very poor studio management and higher executive management.Hardly a competition, forza Horizon@gollumb82 Forza Horizon is different to Gran Turismo. Comparing GT to Forza Motorsport would be a more fair comparison.I voted Project Gotham Racing, I’ve missed that series and I’m totally burnt out with Forza Horizon. I’d seriously roll my eyes if another Horizon is announced.@gollumb82 I've had many arguments about how boring GT is and the attempted ps4 spin off of GT sport was dreadfully boring and painful. Long live forzaFH for me, specifically FH 2. That said, I think developers seem to think that more, or bigger, equates to better, when (as far as I'm concerned) that isn't the case at all. I think it was FH 3, or 4, that I picked up and played, but just felt so overwhelmed by the content.Gameplay diversity and quality over compactness and quantity, imo.@MaccaMUFC That depends. I like both arcade and sim racing (or simcade if you want to be more specific). In terms of the sheer fun factor Forza Horizon mops the floor with any racer out there. I do like Motorsport as well. My favourite is FM6 and I hope FM8 is more like 6 rather than 7 (especially in the career, soundtrack and overall feel department). I get where you're coming from, though. I had to take a break from FH5 as I got tired of it in time. Still, Gran Turismo 7, which I bought at launch because I liked GT Sport well enough, got boring after 10-15 hours. The worst part if it- the catch up you play in most races. No qualifying session etc. Also, the rigged reward tickets that net you the worst possible reward 90% of the time. In short, Forza is way better, whether you're talking Horizon or Motorsport.I'll never forget you, Midnight Club.Couldn't pick there's a lot of good ones on thereForza Horizon is great, but for me it still hasn’t passed the fun I had with PGR, Burnout and Midnight Club. Even some of the Need For Speeds have been amazing over the years.Horizon all the way. Didn't get 5 yet though, still waiting on a sale.PGR for sure. So many great memories of them games.I don't like racing games ...apart from one,burnout paradise the only car game I've ever been able to get Into for some reason and I loved it it so much I had to do it all over again on the remasterI’ve got so many great memories of the first Test Drive Unlimited. At that time, it seemed like a totally new experience and concept. So many times I’d just randomly pick up someone’s tail and just follow them, overtaking, then over taking me etc.I really enjoyed Forza Horizon 4, really connected with that game. Forza Horizon 5 on the other hand, couldn’t stand it! So much confusion on the map, online community ***** that I didn’t care about. I’m not expecting much from the next Horizon game.PGR. Bring it back and remind everyone.Assetto Corsa Competizione with the caveat that you are playing on a series X (it's rough on the S and they stopped supporting last gen.)In terms of the driving and racing experience it blows everything else out of the water once you are in the actual race.It helps if you can find an organised league which do pop up if you look.While there is no doubt it's 100% better on pc it getting better on the series X with each patch. Wish 505 pushed them out quicker and were better a communicating about progress.I really wish we had more actual sim racers on current gen. I think the X has the capability and I can't be the only one who wants to see something like rFactor or Automobalista 2 make the jump.Simcade games are ok as far as they go and a decent stepping stone we just need more full sim options to complete the step.Not all that into driving games, but I liked the one with the Geometry Wars machine in the garage. I played that more than the game.@Eleventy8 I have the same memories of Test Drive Unlimited. An open-world racer seemed so magical at the time, years before FH and The Crew would emulate it. Test Drive Unlimited walked so FH could run.Easy, Forza Motorsport, I bought my Series S only to play that game, sad that is not releasing this yearGarfield Kart, obviously.Loved PGR but if I had to choose between it or Forza Horizon, I’d have to go with FH. I’ve probably spent more time playing FH games than anything else in my console gaming lifetime.FH is a different beast that is unmatched.I chose TDU. Forza was simply too obvious of a choice, and PGR was great but TDU felt the most special to me.An obscure hidden gem reference I would make: Import Tuner Challenge, an old Xbox 360 exclusive, which was actually the final game in the Tokyo Xtreme Racer series.Outrun is not in the poll!

It's not exactly a surprise, but it seems to be an official announcement of sorts.Unfortunately, the team isn't ready to share any details just yet. Here's exactly what he had to say:\"Here at id, the team is hard at work on our next big game...although we are not ready to share those details quite yet...\"id Software most recently released DOOM Eternal in 2020, followed by a few expansion. And today, it's also finally launched the free-to-play PC game Quake Champions.What would you like to see next from id Software?

I got a Series X again for Starfield and Hellblade 2, but all I've played on Xbox this gen are mostly X360 and Xbox One games. Well that and a few indies on Game Pass.Should port quake champions to the Xbox I tried playing it on my pc but it won't run it@gollumb82 It is a bit like Xbox came to the race track with the best car with the best features in my opinion but forgot the petrol to run it. I know each company has the odd quiet year games wise but Xbox are pushing their luck now and when they do release these big AAA games they best be extremely good else I think my Xbox days will be numbered.Actually coming this November 2022 new AAA exclusive game wise we seem to be worse off than the Xbox one. I don’t think the Xbox one ever had a whole year without at least one big AAA exclusive from an Xbox studio. Begs the question how the hell did Xbox let that happen.A new quake would be awesome@Dezzy70 I couldn't have put it any better. I started this gen with Xbox and got a PS5 somewhere along the way. Gotta say that the PS5 is primarily for Sony so-called exclusives because as a console the Series X is better in many ways IMHO. Still, no games means that I'm playing the waiting game. It's even worse as I'm not a fan of Halo or Gears (I do love Forza Horizon and Motorsport). Fingers crossed for 2023 which could be a breakout year for Xbox with Starfield, Forza Motorsport 8 and maybe Stalker/Hellblade 2. We'll see, but I'll stick with Xbox for BC games if nothing else (PCs are for work as far as I'm concerned).@Dezzy70 They let half of their good studios go and thought they could coast by with just the big IPs and passive income from being the \"media centre\". Obviously a dumb strategy.I think they are struggling in these years in particular partly because of covid, but also, all their studios, legacy or purchased, were all just releasing, or had just released their latest title.After this year, there should be a more stable flow of games. They'll have the in house studios to support the flow, and they'll be starting to wrap up their new projects. All they have to do then is spread out the releases.@gollumb82 Cancel my comment about leaving Xbox I don’t think I ever can being honest. See I like Halo, Gears and Forza I was there at the start and can’t get enough. I want a massive new Gears and some Halo campaign DLC and of course have FH5 All third party games I play on series x. Hopefully 2023 will be a great year Xbox wise. I think Sony will have a quiet 2023 compared to 2022, don’t think Spider-Man 2 will make it 2023 and don’t think they will have another big AAA from their studios ready. I maybe wrong.@Richnj Totally agree with you there. Yes they need to learn to spread their big AAA releases, a bit like Sony have done this year 2022So next year 2023 Xbox should be able to do that. Though we have no release dates yet for Starfield and Redfall, looking forward to Redfall as I like fps and vampires and Arkane Studios.I mean it's not like they are going to say \"Well we are just sat here doing nothing\". Of course they will be working on somethingI will pay more attention when they say what the something is and even more attention when it has a solid release date.If the past year has taught me anything it's to not be excited for anything until it's got a solid release date and even then temper that excitement till maybe a week before release in case of delays.I'm hoping it's a new Ip instead of another doom.Not because doom is bad or anything but just because the same Studio making the same game all the time every gen can get a bit stale, I like it when Studio's mix it up and create new ambitious ip's like guerilla did when they moved on from Killzone.Same can be said about a lot of studios as well, time to give uncharted, far cry a rest and try something differentThe development times for games seem to have stretched out more and more. The entire Mass Effect trilogy came out over 5 years. If they started making it now I’d bet against my living long enough to play the whole trilogy.Xbox needs successors to Gears and Halo. New IPs that will be system sellers. STARFIELD is a good example if the game turns out to be good but more new IP is needed. Whole new experiences.@UltimateOtaku91 \"just because the same Studio making the same game all the time every gen can get a bit stale\"Haha, 343i.Seriously though. I agree. iD are also too good to waste to place them on autopilot like that. Doom, Wolfenstein, Rage are all in good places from a design POV. They could do with either one release a generation, or left with third party devs to continue. iD either needs to refresh Quake or get a new IP out.\"Killzone\"Coincedentially, I went back to Killzone HD last night to do my Rico/Hard run and finally got my plat on it. I have to go through the other Killzones again, but I'm going to try plat Resistance 3 first (already done superhuman, so it shouldn't be too bad). I miss these franchises. I don't care if it's sister studios being opened up or third party devs being asked, but I'd love for them to come back. I'm totally ok with derivative and budget entries in to older franchises.I'm betting a pretty penny that it's H-Doom 2, I can feel it.@Richnj CoD is easily to blame for the end of Killzone, Resistance and SOCOM. Sony got the CoD marketing and timed exclusivity deal in 2015 then following that they released 0 FPS/TPS games.Sony's right when they say CoD is in a league of its own but they are to blame for that. What Sony did was the equivalent of if Microsoft killed off franchises like Halo and Gears in 2009.For the love of God, and all that is holy. Quake 1 reboot.@Clankylad Exactly this. Maybe people forget that Sony takes 4yrs+ between games with their Studio's. Ghost of Tsushima released 6yrs after Infamous Second Son, Horizon:Zero Dawn was nearly 5yrs after Killzone Shadowfall and took 5yrs to make a sequel. GT7 released nearly 5yrs after GT Sport and Turn 10 have needed over 5yrs to make a brand new Forza Motorsport - something that used to take 2yrs.New Game Engines (like Unreal 5) may help reduce development times, but that only released (officially as 'production ready') a few months ago. I'm sure its 'compatible' with UE4 when moving game development across, but those games would not be built the Nanite/Lumin advantages of UE5. Therefore, there is going to be 'work' to utilise those if they want to use them.Looking at 'individual' slices of time throughout a generation can make things look 'much better/worse' for a specific platform. After R&C released in June, the 'next' Sony made exclusive to release was Horizon Forbidden west. I know they had some 3rd party exclusives (inc Deathloop) but in that same 'period' MS released MSFS, AoE4, Halo, FH5, Psychonauts 2 and Deathloop. I know that Xbox Console only gamers didn't get to play AoE4 or Deathloop and Psychonauts 2 wasn't 'exclusive', but thats still 'their' studios and still had to make those games.Talking of Psychonauts 2, that's another that's taken a while to develop. They were making that when they joined in late 2018, not even 4yrs ago.People look back on generations 'differently' in hindsight. At the start of the XB1 era, there were comments about Sony's lack of games compared to MS. Then 'resolution' and of course the issues of that disaster of an E3 before, was 'more' important than Exclusives for Sony fanboys - saying that playing BF, CoD, AC4, etc at higher visual quality and/or performance mattered most as more people play multi-platform games. Of course as MS games 'dried' up and Sony started hitting their stride with nearly 3x more studio's as well as buying up 'Exclusivity' and ''Marketing' deals, the rhetoric changed.At the end of the Generation, that's when you can look back and really assess the generation. Xbox gave us a LOT of great things during the XB1 era and implemented a massive shift in its Gaming Business model - merging its small 'Console' division fully integrating it into Microsoft. Xbox ceased to be 'just' the Console and became MS's Gaming brand. Built up their Studio/IP portfoliios, Publishing, Cloud based platform, Back Compatibility Programme, arguably the 'best' hardware of the generation and has started off this generation MUCH stronger.There was a time when people questioned whether MS would sell any Series consoles - especially a discless, weak but cheap Series S. What with having 'no' exclusives (due to day 1 PC/cloud releases) and its 'only' exclusives that 'sell' hardware...@Grumblevolcano I understand and agree with Sony in so far that nothing can compete with COD. It's true. But I also don't agree with their belief that these games had to compete with COD.It was the same criticism I levied against MS with Halo. They tried so hard to shift Halo to beat, or leech off of, COD (which was never going to happen), instead of scaling back Halo to match the Halo community.Apart from being shooter games with online MP, they are nothing alike. There's room enough for all of them. Especially if you dropped the unnecessary MP modes on some. Like, Resistance is better in its co-operative MP than it ever was in competitive MP.@SplooshDmg Trent Reznor or no buy, tho.@UltimateOtaku91 Non-Doom would be nice, but, I don't think a genre change would be it. id is the FPS company...they've never made non FPS's, ever. Whatever it is, it's an FPS....they invented the genre, everyone else is just a clone.@gollumb82 To be fair, Ratchet & Clank, Kena, and Returnal are the only non-PS4 games I've played on my PS5, either..... It's ok, there's already too much to play on my PS4 Pro Plus and Xbox One X2..... I like my new video card upgrades. They're machines to play the last 10 years of games on, but make it so they don't suck and run like garbage. @NEStalgia I'm ready for id Kart Racing. Choose between Doom Guy, Baron of Hell, Shambler, or even Shub-Niggurath and race to the finish!@gollumb82 The biggest mistake in my opinion is them not starting work on Gears 6 until after the Series X came out. It won't be on shelves until 2026, I'm guessing.And what the heck are some of these studios doing? Compulsion Games, some others... I want to see State of Decay 3, Everwild went back to the drawing board... At least they're being held up by their long-lasting multiplayer games such as Sea of Thieves, Grounded, Forza and Halo, when that finally becomes a good game, which is no sooner than 2024 lol. And their Game Pass deals. I can finally play the Persona franchise. Specifically, 3, as I played 4 and beat 5.@SplooshDmg nail packs instead of banana peels, BFG for blue shells. Chainsaw for green shells. This could work!@Royalblues\n",
      "Well said. I don't recall a console launch with basically zero launch games... The Xbox team have done a great job with the hardware, but dropped the ball hard when it comes to software. I mean, I'm in a much better position as I'm relatively new to Xbox. Series X is my first ever Xbox and I have a lot to play with Fable, Gears and Halo. The Xbox faithful can't say the same. It just seems logical for them to have prepared at least 2-3 killer games for the console launch. 2 years later and all we have is Halo Infinite and FH5 while Sony has Demon's Souls, Miles Morales, Ratchet, Kena, GT7, Horizon FW and soon God of War Ragnarok. It looks bad and even Phil is looking forward to playing Sony exclusives, as pathetic as it sounds.@Royalblues I said a while back, the issue with Xbox isn't necessarily their ability to cobble together a great game. The issue at hand is, it's just hard to consistently count on them to deliver said game. I think in time it will surely get better, but the whole turning over a new leaf with the Series X|S just isn't happening the way it needed too. As gollumb82 points out, for people new to Xbox, there is a lot to catch up on. However, for the Xbox faithful, it's just more waiting like last gen.@Richnj I agree it didn't need to compete with CoD, I was looking more that from 2015 onwards CoD was the shooter franchise for Playstation but if Killzone/Resistance/SOCOM stayed CoD would've been a shooter franchise for Playstation (still the biggest but just an option).It's like how there'd still be plenty of people who would buy Nintendo hardware for JRPGs like Xenoblade and Fire Emblem even if the Pokemon franchise ended with Scarlet/Violet.@SplooshDmg @gollumb82 I think they need to create more division manager positions. People to oversee studios and have more of a firm hand on their output. The pandemic has affected everyone, no doubt, but if you look around, people have still been consistently cranking out games. This kind of thing tells me that many of these studios have had quiet years where they've not been working on anything, or certainly not their latest releases.@Royalblues You may be onto something here. As much as I appreciate Phil as the leader he may just need some help in keeping all those studios \"hard at work\".@Royalblues While I think there are some issues at hand, I do think there's some truth to the matter that a lot of Xbox studios had released a game right at the end of last gen. Games that just weren't exclusives due to prior commitments. Also, so many coming Xbox games are using UE5. I kinda wonder if that's causing some issues. I mean, it's not like we've really seen much of UE5 from anyone just yet. Halo was apparently just crippled by ambition that couldn't be executed. So I sorta do wonder if they've put too many eggs in the UE5 basket by wanting to make these stunning games, and now it's just taking ages to get them out the door.Please be a single player Quake reboot, done in the same gothic/horror style of the first game.@Would_you_kindly apparently it got leaked, I would love to see that too, takes ages to load on my PC then crashes anyway, could also be a resurgence for the gameHe looks like woody Harrison Tap here to load 32 commentsLeave A CommentHold on there, you need to login to post a comment...Two More Games Added To September 2022's Xbox Game Pass LineupAlong with news of a delaySome Notable Titles Are Leaving Xbox Game Pass This Month (August 31)10 in totalNew Lord Of The Rings Game Announced By 2K Publisher Private DivisionExpected to launch 2023-24Xbox Game Pass Is Hurting Right Now, But Larger Forces Are At PlayAll we need, is just a little patienceFour Games Are Confirmed For Xbox Game Pass In September 2022 So FarUpdate: Make that five! 31Pick One What's The Best Racing Series In Xbox History? 9Video Here's A Look At Xbox 360 Emulation On The Steam Deck 14Talking Point What September 2022 Xbox Games With Gold Do You Want? 8News Who's Your Daddy?!

Hosted by 44 Bytes.Wait, Did Xbox Pay $600K For Cooking Simulator On Game Pass?GuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpThat seems a lot if trueWe've never really been privy to the kind of money Microsoft spends on Xbox Game Pass titles, generally because it's seen as confidential information, although we may have received a peek behind the curtain for the new addition of Cooking Simulator.As discovered by Twisted Voxel, a recent financial report relating to developer Big Cheese Studio appears to suggest that the figure might have been around the $600,000 mark, which seems a big deal for a game like Cooking Simulator!It's worth mentioning the report comes from the Warsaw Stock Exchange website, so some details might be lost in (Google) translation. It seems to indicate that the 600k figure is \"approximately 22% of the net profit and approximately 17% of the company's net revenue from the sale of products, goods and materials for the last financial year\".The only other time we've heard about a figure for a Game Pass game was back in March, when it was reported that Microsoft paid around 5-10 million US dollars to get Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy on the service.Here's a look at how Cooking Simulator has reportedly grown its player base since joining Game Pass:So, what do you think? Does this sound realistic to you? Let us know down in the comments below.[source gpw.pl, via twistedvoxel.com]About Fraser GilbertFraser has an unhealthy obsession for all things related to Telltale Games' The Walking Dead series, and has an intimate knowledge of sports games on Xbox. He also supports Walsall FC – that team in the West Midlands you've never heard of.Comments (15)I mean, 600k doesn't seem like much. It's a $20 game with an 84% positive on Steam. 600k is only the price of 30,000 retail copies. When you consider there's 25million-ish Game Pass users and simulator games are a pretty popular genre, it adds up to me.Damn that's good money. I wonder how much those single developer games get. Like I wonder how much they paid for Midnight Fight Express. This could be lucrative for single developers, go to game pass via the Xbox ID program.It'd be interesting to see what GP makes on average, month by month, to weigh these numbers up against. Either way, that's good money. I wonder how long $600k gets to keep the game on GP for - which is another important factor - months, a year, etc...When you hear stories like this, how many millions they're paying for 3rd party, you really do start to see just how Sony is going to struggle to compete with their subscription services. Can't blame Sony for spending money on marketing rights that end up blocking or delaying gamepass releases...they have to compete. Be frustrated at MS, who have a bottomless well of money, for not being on the ball and getting those marketing rights first.They used to be a lot more aggressive with marketing back in the 360 days. Hopefully PlayStations blocking attempt of the acquisition, and MS perceived frustration of not being able to get certain games on gamepass, will have Xbox more aggressive again when it comes to striking marketing deals.Don't know if 600k is a lot or not for this sort of game to be on gamepass and in all honesty I don't really care.I think folks get too hung up on how much or not something costs Microsoft or Sony or whoever.To me as an end user gamer it's just useless information that has no bearing on the quality or fun of the game in question.They probably added $400k to make sure it never goes on a Sony subscription service. 😄@SplooshDmg Yeah. 600k seems cheap to me too. 25 million subscribers at $10 per month is 250 million per month. They can add 400 cooking simulators and one month's revenue would cover it.@Kaloudz I’d imagine it’s at least 200,000,000 a month. They say they have close to 30,000,000 subscribers by now. Not all are paying 15 bucks for gpu. And some are taking that 1 dollar deal (but since that can only be used once per account those situations are much less now than a few years ago). Assuming they’re making an average of 7 bucks per subscription (not unreasonable) that’d be 200,000,000.@xMightyMatt14x Man that's quite impressive. I expect those prices to soar once the acquisition goes through and more get added to the catalogue.Doesn't seem like that much to me. Maybe for that game in particular as it's a couple of years old but they've got to make it worth the developers while to make their game free across multiple platforms (assuming it's on pc pass too) world wide.MS is no doubt making money hand over fist from Gamepass too. $600k would be a tiny fraction of their monthly turnover from the service.Either way it's safe to assume that the bean counters at MS know what they're doing.@Kaloudz If they can increase their subscriber count, they won't need to raise prices since they'll be bringing in more money from volume.@NotoriousWhiz True, true. On the other hand, I do ponder how much all their studios cost to run. That mustn't be cheap. Hence why I'm surprised there's delays and lack of releases, first party, because that must surely leave a dent?@Kaloudz that is very true. Realistically, with the sheer amount of value we will be getting after the AB purchase and when the new games start getting released (Hellblade 2, Starfield, Avowed, the whole list), I wouldn’t be terribly mad at a price increase. I’d imagine maybe 20 for GPU? Everything is a value proposition so a price increase is probable, but not terrible unless it soars too high too fast, or price goes up before we get the increased volume of AAA games.@xMightyMatt14x Aye that sounds about right. I imagine we will get a gradual increase too, eventually. Obviously MS make money from other platform sales too, but I can't imagine they're too happy that a lot of money gets negated whenever there's a delay.Still, I'll be forever subscribed. I love the service. I just can't wait for the time to come in which there's a steady flow of games. I suspect we will be over this hurdle by 2023. Onward from there, with everything they'll own, I'll be surprised if there are any more...@Kaloudz agreed!!

Most, if not all of the footage in here is re-used from the recent showcase reveal, however, the team's discussion around the game's Vampiric open world is pretty interesting.Arkane legend Harvey Smith says the game's open world feels \"expansive\" yet \"lived in\", and it's also the largest open space the team has created to date. The world is centred around on-foot traversal in Redfall, so it won't be the biggest open world ever, but given the nature of the the game there should be plenty to explore within.The discussion also breaks down the game's vampires and Arkane's approach to developing them. The team wanted to create something \"spooky\" rather straight-up scary, and they even dive into how the vampire attire plays a role in creating that mood.All in all, Redfall seems to be shaping up pretty nicely, and with Deathloop's exclusivity period soon coming to an end, we're pretty hyped to go hands on with two Arkane adventures on Xbox pretty darn soon.Are you liking the look of Redfall? Or does Deathloop entice you more? Leave your thoughts down below.About Ben KerryBen is a fan of action, racing and straight-up shootin' in any video game he can get his hands on. When he's not gaming, Ben spends his time listening to way too much Guns N' Roses, watching football and probably eating somewhere.Comments (18)I'm looking forward to this. The first time i saw it i had the idea it was just another coop shooter like Left for dead and such. But since seeing more and more from it and it being a single player FPS/RPG combination which can be played coop, it keep getting me more and more interested in this game. I cant wait to play this now and that while im not the biggest shooter fan generally.This is the one for me next year. Like Arkane, fps and vampires. Game pass day one. Glad to hear they are putting a lot into the world etc. Just a release date now please.Let’s hope Microsoft advertise the hell out this game and give it some good PR. It’s a new ip AAA looking great so far, they need to get the word out on release etc. one reason Sony does so well is amazing PR even with most new IPs. Then it’s pure word and mouth.The handling of Hive Busters PR was shocking Microsoft could have made that game their Miles Morale equivalent when the new consoles released. Microsoft’s problem is they don’t know how to PR outside of USA and create hype, then no one knows about their big AAA games and IPs.@Dezzy70 I agree, Sony do a much better job at promoting their products. Maybe it’s because they’re mainly a media group whereas Windows basically sells itself. I’ve lost count of the times I’ve seen something that is available on all platforms advertised with PlayStation branding on telly or the side of a bus. I rarely remember seeing something with Xbox branding. Seems a bit of a blind spot, even Nintendo do it better.@Clankylad They used to be good in the Xbox360 era the PR was up their with the best. Let’s hope 2023 they start a really good Xbox consoles, game pass and AAA game advertising PR campaign. The whole Xbox ecosystem really needs it for sure. Momentum in the UK is starting to slacken slowly but surly.I'm looking forward to this, it's shaping uo very nicelyI thought this was similar to back 4 Blood and left 4 dead? But it can't be if its open world.Makes me more interested in this now, especially if its doable solo@Retrokingdan Arthur !!!This hasn't been on my radar. Its always been something that I kept an eye on because I like the 'theme' they are going for, but I wasn't sure I'd get much out of it due to its seemingly 'online co-operative' game structure.However, as more and more info has come out, especially this video, I am actually beginning to look forward to this. It seems like it will be a Fun solo experience with great systems to tailor your game-play preference that can become even 'crazier' with more 'characters' to combine 'skills'. My one concern still is 'balance'. I don't want to feel I have to rely on 'others' to progress due to Solo damage output and/or enemy counts designed to challenge 3 or 4 players. Scaling the challenge based on player counts is something that I want to see...The more I see, the more its piquing my interest and now I am looking forward to seeing more and/or getting to try it myself...Wish I could get excited for this - and that last pic does look great. Everything I hear about this though sounds like it’s pulling in a lot of directions…yet lacks direction…if that makes sense. It sounds ambitious but nothing I’ve seen looks like it’s nailing anything particularly well. I guess I just don’t know how they will pull off something that was clearly designed for co op as a fulfilling sp game. And how different it will be from the countless other games in the L4D mould. And I love Arkane games…this one just isn’t doing it for me at the moment.@Dezzy70 got to do something since divorcing Olive and gaming is it 😂Still not really sold on this game. I can't tell if it's the actual design or just because the horror \"it's a zombie game but we're going to call them vampires this time\" theme is just not in my wheelhouse.@Clankylad Definitely, marketing is at Sony's core really, and always has been. Like you said, music, movies, and TV are among their core businesses, and those are traditionaly built around 100% pure marketing. They had that know-how by default.Microsoft..... Well, good marketing is how Windows beat OS/2 Warp, unfortunately (remember they were the first company to ever get the Rolling Stones for an ad, Windows \"Start Me Up\" commercial is the reason the far superior OS/2 Warp failed and we've had Windows ever since.) But since then what have they really advertised other than \"hey, we're here\" type advertising? I remember the Vista ad saturation campaign but that's about it!Inject it into my veins. I'll play anything Arkane, and if this is the closest to a new Dishonored I'll get, then so be it.@Retrokingdan Well you should get out to work on the buses with Stan and Jack 😂@Dezzy70 Totally agree. Their PR can suck, big time. Crackdown 3's PR was outright cringe.On topic, I'm actually starting to get a bit excited for this now. I just hope the \"lived in\" statement is true in practice.@Dezzy70 😂😂@Kaloudz I’m looking forward to Redfall as well. As time has gone on, it seems to get better and better with each little bit of detail.@Dezzy70 Yeah exactly. I wasn't sold at first. In fact, I couldn't help but notice how each vampire acted exactly the same in the first gameplay reveal, but as more and more has been unveiled, I'm getting pretty hyped.

Hosted by 44 Bytes.Reaction: Death Stranding's Reception Makes Us Very Excited For Kojima + XboxGuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpWe love it when a plan comes togetherSo, it's really happening folks. Death Stranding, Hideo Kojima's latest game, is coming Xbox Game Pass for PC. Sadly, we likely won't ever see an Xbox port for this one (on console it's published by Sony), but the news of its PC Game Pass arrival is getting us real excited for Kojima's proper Xbox project.Back in June, we got official confirmation that Kojima Productions is working with Xbox on a new game. It'll leverage the cloud in some fashion, but beyond that, we really have no idea how this project will take shape. However, given Death Stranding's standout success, we're not really worried about what 'type' of game it'll be.In the run up to Death Stranding's initial launch, in typical Kojima fashion, we saw plenty of downright bizarre promos and trailers about the team's upcoming project. For months no-one really knew what Death Stranding actually was, even when attempts were made to try and explain it.When it did eventually launch in 2019, as it turns out, it ended up being a 20+ hour delivery simulator about big backpacks and even bigger ladders. Yeah, there's a lot more to it than that when you really get into the weeds, but boiling it down, Death Stranding is a 'walking simulator' on steroids, with huge production values and a lengthier runtime.We typically see some reservation whenever a game has 'cloud-based' attached to it - hell, we're all still a little bit scarred from Crackdown 3's attempts to utilise the cloud. However, given Kojima's track record at turning bizarre ideas into very good games, we have no doubt that his Xbox project will come good.For now, we've just got to play the waiting game. June's announcement post seemed to insinuate that this one is still in its incubation phase, meaning we probably won't get to play it for a number of years. When the trailers begin rolling in closer to launch though, don't expect to understand what the hell's going on. It still might be a tad confusing after you've played it!In the meantime though, if you have a decent enough PC, maybe giving Death Stranding a whirl will prepare you for what's next. Or maybe not? Either way, it's a very good get for the PC Game Pass library.Will you be playing Death Stranding on Game Pass? Do let us know!About Ben KerryBen is a fan of action, racing and straight-up shootin' in any video game he can get his hands on. When he's not gaming, Ben spends his time listening to way too much Guns N' Roses, watching football and probably eating somewhere.Comments (44)So the \"walking simulator\" is being received well for PC. Good....One of the few ps exclusives I actually enjoyed...currently enjoying Ghost of Tsunami aswell..I've still yet to play it on PS5, but I keep hearing good things. Bad ones, too (like the \"walking simulator\" or \"boring game\"). You may not like Kojima for his outlandish ideas or wacky plot of MGS, but there's no denying that his Xbox game will generate a lot of hype from the Xbox crowd and cries of treason from the Sony camp 😎I reckon flight sim, and cloud gaming, has removed a lot of those reservations about the cloud. The potential is huge...but hopefully he'll keep grounded - we don't want a walking sim where you walk around a full scale globe. I'm really hoping it's a horror game - one that's released in weekly episodes like a TV show. One that uses the cloud to incorporate current events.Actually scrap that, I really hope it's silent hills...just for the laugh.Tbh though,there's now rumours he may be doing a psvr2 game...now that would be something I'd love to play!As I have mentioned elsewhere my overall impression of this game having played it to completion on a ps4 pro was boredom or just a sense of waiting for the fun to startStill if you have PC gamepass and have not tried it elsewhere I would still encourage you to at least try it.You never know it might click for you in a way it didn't for me.This is the main reason I feel that I don't need a PS5. All the games I want to play are either multiplat or the are coming to PC so I can just play them there.@BBB how long did it take you to complete? I played it for around 15 hours and dropped it, it just wasn’t fun. I kept seeing people saying ‘it gets better’ etc but it never did, not in my experience. I wasn’t willing to invest anymore time.I think it's funny that this old game that's been on PC forever already is getting more attention and hype now that it's coming to PC Game Pass than it ever did on PS4, lol.@Fenbops Just checked the last save game and that clocked in at 48 hours and 15 minutes.That was just a story playthrough and not trophy chasing (which is something I rarely do.).I played this while my country was in full COVID lockdown and I do remember forcing myself to keep going. I think in other circumstances I would have dropped it too.Of all the games Kojima was involved with I only ever managed to finish two: MGS2 and Castelvania LOS. And it's definitely not due to lack of trying - there was MGS4 ,5, Snake Eater and even Pace Walker, never hold my interest long enough to finish them.I'm curious to see what he is cooking up with his next project regardless.Got to love watching people's minds on Kojima change solely based on the platform he's working on.@NEStalgia more attention & hype?...you must have missed E3 2016 when it was announced@StylesT Ghost of Tsushima is an excellent game and I hope you have a lot of fun with it.If that came to PC gamepass that would be something for folks to be really excited for (though probably will never happen.)@uptownsoul not mine,I'm still not a fan of his and I've played death stranding and got very bored\n",
      "This is great news for everyone that will enjoy it but I didn'tThe thing that gets me is the hell he is getting ,one tweet callls him a (swear word) traitor and told him to remove his tweet about it coming to pc game passWow just wow@uptownsoul No, I didn't miss it. The attention was on Kojima walking on a beam of light (I'm back!), and Norman Reedus' bare bottom in a confusing trailer that told us nothing about what the game even was. The hype was about what we DIDN'T know, not the actual game. When the actual game landed it was kind of a deflation of all that hype.I have a PS4, is this worth picking up? Seems to have provoked a marmite response, but it will only be a few quid to buy.I played this and found it repetitive and boring.@NEStalgia today is just the announcement for Death Stranding in PC gamepass...The apples to apples comparison would be the original E3 2016 announcement.Also if you call Death Stranding launching in top 10 NPD in November 2019 (source: https://mobile.twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1205261069641322497 ) deflated hype, I'd like to have whatever potent drink you're sipping on...lol.@NEStalgia and let's be honest...the real reason why this announcement is getting the hype it is...is b/c Xbox gamers want PlayStation games...If this were a typical 3rd party game (like Watch Dog Legions, etc)...it wouldn't have a quarter of the hype...Not my cup of proverbial tea. I do hope that the people who have looked forward to it enjoy it, but from what I've seen, it takes a little bit more than that to both interest me and impress me.@uptownsoul I agree the hype is fanboy related, but I don't think it's as much about \"Xbox gamers want PS games\" (and in this case, it's PC gamers, not xbox gamers, and Sony gives them PS games officially, anyway, and the game's already been on PC for a long while) as much as just a chance to strike a blow against PS, the enemy!It's not like a platform that didn't already have access to the game for years is getting access to it other than those streaming-only casuals @NEStalgia \"but I don't think it's as much about \"Xbox gamers want PS games\"...You sure about that...b/c this very site had Xbox console gamers complaining that God of War wasn't streamable to Xbox consoles...Sounds a lot like Xbox gamers wanting PS games to me@uptownsoul I remember a thread where people were annoyed that there was specific removal or blocking or something going on surrounding GoW, though I still think it's a similar fanboy kind of thing of striking a blow against Sony, more than actually WANTING to play the game specifically. I'm sure some do, but I imagine most that actually wanted to play it played it on a PS or eventually played on PC. Or streamed it on Now. So mostly just internet war cries in both cases....@NEStalgia I honestly just think a lot of it is fanboy nonsense. It's the whole \"Only on Playstation... OR IS IT!?\" thing. Fanboys jumping through hoops to make a game playable on an oppositional console for the sake of no other reason than they can.All that said though, I do think there is some genuine want for games like say, Spiderman. I mean, it's Spiderman. He's only the most popular super hero bar none. So I think there's truth to both sides of this here. Console warriors like to beat drums and I'm sure a lot of Xbox players would genuinely enjoy Ghost of Tsushima if it appeared on an Xbox someday.@NEStalgia yeah but the whole \"strike a blow at Sony\" is primarily from Xbox gamers, not PC...And a lot of that wanting to strike at Sony is over wanting the games (or at least wanting the games to be available on Xbox)...FF7, Spidey, for a while Persona 5, etc.The only reason it's getting an article is because it's a ps exclusive on a Xbox/pc service...it's the first game to do that isn't itSimilar to how the baseball game got hype at the timeNothing to do with Xbox gamers wanting the games lolStill think headlines should be changed. Its not coming to xbox gamepass but PC gamepass.@Rmg0731 I had actually thought about this. The name 'Xbox Game Pass For PC' was legitimately retired and replaced with just 'PC Game Pass'. The previous headline is honestly just incorrect.@uptownsoul @SplooshDmg Yeah a bit of both, but let's be real, most of the people beating the fanboy drums own both consoles and played these games years ago @NEStalgia I decided a while ago that I'm just an enjoyer of games. I get being a fan of one platform over the other, no harm there. But some of these raging fan boys are as insufferable as political pundits. People arguing over AAA exclusives and minuscule performance differences, and I'm sitting over here with a 3080ti playing Quake II, because I'm an idiot. @SplooshDmg But it's the highest quality pixels anyone's ever seen in quake 2!@NEStalgia You know, it's honestly kinda wild how well it's held up in 4K. This game was just so outrageously ahead of it's time. It's still a blast to play even today.@uptownsoul don't forget it's also a Kojima game. And it's not like the hype isn't well deserved.Death Stranding is a game I've always been curious to try but couldn't because I don't own a Sony hardware, and just accepted it wasn't meant to be. Now it's coming to PC Game Pass and I still won't be able to play it because my PC is not good for gaming. I hope they somehow find a way to add it to Cloud Gaming. That would be the only way I could viably play the game.@Cherip-the-Ripper oh I agree...thats why I can't wait to see how they build on things with Death Stranding 2@deadmaker IDK if it's on Game Pass Cloud, but even without Sony hardware, couldn't you just subscribe to PS Plus Premium for a month and steam it on their cloud service on your PC?PS fanboys may make you believe only Microsoft offers streaming, but Sony does too....  (At least for ps1,2,3,4 games.... Not ps5 games.)@NEStalgia fairly certain they don't offer streaming in brazil (yet)@Cherip-the-Ripper oh, that's one of the \"plus deluxe\" zones? That's a shame.I do wish it would have been the \"Directors Cut\" version of the game. But I personally do not have my new gaming rig anywys for the time being.But when I get a new 3090, and already have Game Pass Ultimate thanks to MS Rewards Points. I will give this game a spin.I clearly remember the launch of this game, and just how hyped everyone was for it. Then it comes out.... and lets just say, it did not hit the ground running but more so hit the ground like a sopping wet towel haha. I watched multiple people play it and their receptions were all like \"uhhh what the hell, Where is the game?\" and \"This cut scene has been 20 minutes and shows no sign of stopping\" LOL That is how Kojima games are though... He loves creating these super long cut scenes, he will be making full length movies for the cinema before his career is over 100%.The main game play mechanic of walking while trying to maintain these packages that throw you off balance... that really does seem like it could be a very short lived experience as far as the fun factor. BUTT I could also see the narrative and the community aspect of building things that will show up in other peoples games and visa versa, being a pretty cool and hopefully motivating and compelling thing... I am looking forward to someday seeing how it works with me (but I am not super excited to where I am working hard to get to play the game or anything either)Another great job for the Game Pass team and whoever got this deal to go through. This and MLB The Show has got to PISS OFF SONY execs like no other lol! PlayStation curated content being utilized in Xbox Game Pass in anyway, even if it is just in the PC library, is the last place they want to see content they spent large chunks of investment money in being at.Its pretty sad that an old release ps4 game, thats already been on pc for ages, appears to be getting mindshare from an xbox site?Its not coming to xbox and never will, why 'PC game comes to PC game service' is exiting anyone here is beyond me. Shows how dead xbox is atm fir this to even be an article....I enjoy the game myself, but I couldn't unreservedly recommend it, as its slow and a grind. But if it grabs you, its a unique experience, so its worth trying if you have pc gp... .This has been the perfect PR for PC games on Game Pass ...The mailman sim.@NEStalgia People were pretty excited for Death Stranding. Its PS4 release was absolutely a bigger deal than this PC GP port. Maybe not for you, personally, but in general for sure.Besides, I think most of the attention the game is getting right now is amusement over how Sony seems unable to keep games they were involved with developing off of Game Pass.@Ralizah oh I definitely agree on the reason for the attention right now. It was kind of tongue in cheek that it's getting more hype than when it released originally.

Things are getting pretty mental in the final season to be honest, as CoD goes into full nostalgia mode with crossovers.Leading the way is Season 5's cover star: classic villain Raul Menendez. The iconic figure, from 2012's Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, returns as the main operator for the new content drop. However, the nostalgia doesn't stop there.Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is also getting in on the act. The Modern Warfare villain, Khaled Al-Asad, will also feature in the new season, alongside Black Ops 3's Seraph and Gabriel Rorke, from Call of Duty: Ghosts. There's even a laser beam weapon in here from Advanced Warfare, because, why not?!It's all a bit of a mish-mash then, before the series gets a sort-of reboot with 'Call of Duty Next'. Still, it's kind of cool to see all the games and subseries' cross over, with Call of Duty beginning to mix and match its previously-defined eras. All of this classic content begins to rollout in Vanguard & Warzone next week, on August 24th.Will you be jumping into this new season to check out the classic content? Let us know!About Ben KerryBen is a fan of action, racing and straight-up shootin' in any video game he can get his hands on. When he's not gaming, Ben spends his time listening to way too much Guns N' Roses, watching football and probably eating somewhere.Comments (2)Out of all of the possible operators to make it to Vanguard, I'm slightly surprised that Pierson from WWII never made the cut. WWII's ending had him returning to war and Vanguard is meant to be the sequel since Howard's brother is an operator. Guess Josh is all-in on The Callisto Protocol.I wish the battle passes worked for more than the most recent game. I don't really play Warzone and I still prefer Black Ops 2020 over Vanguard by far, so I have been unlocking a bunch of BP rewards on it, but never use them... But that's my own issue.

Sneak out late, make new friends, uncover hidden truths, and collect words that will change the course of fate!Continue the adventures of Beatrix LeBeau as she journeys across the Slime Sea to Rainbow Island, a land brimming with ancient mysteries, and bursting with wiggly, new slimes to wrangle in this sequel to the smash-hit, Slime Rancher.Excited for either of these? Let us know down in the comments section below.About Fraser GilbertFraser has an unhealthy obsession for all things related to Telltale Games' The Walking Dead series, and has an intimate knowledge of sports games on Xbox. He also supports Walsall FC – that team in the West Midlands you've never heard of.Comments (19)After watching a certain isekai anime im now in the mood to raise some slimes, slime rancher looks fun but is there actually a story to it? Or is it just aimlessly going around collection and breeding slimes?I was told about slime rancher from a member from here ( sorry don't remember thier name ) and i really really enjoyed it , really excited for the sequal day one play for meIt's a shame High on Life has been delayed but at least it's coming in DecemberThe High on Life news is good news for me because I was thinking it was a 2023 release anyway.High on Life will most likely be pushed to 2023 in a further delaydude high on life will get delayed again 2023..It's the xbox curse.GuaranteeSeptember is going to be one hell of a month!! Can't wait.Damn...in December...Callisto Protocol and in January Dead Space Remake.They should rethink that launch window.@UltimateOtaku91 Not sure about the sequel, but the first game doesn't really have any story to it outside of the premise.That said, it's one hell of a peaceful, chilled game. You go out, you collect slimes, unlock new areas via gathering currency from feeding said slimes, and rinse and repeat. There's quite a bit more to it than that (gameplay wise), but that's the general structure.Also... I don't recall that you raise the slimes, so much as just catch them, feed them, and keep them safe. Still, it's a solid game.@FakeSunkist nah totally different genre and not everyone cares about horror games. I'm fully antipicating High on Life but don't care at all about Callisto, Dead Space etcI was so excited for High on Life — I still am, but these delays are getting annoying. Please stop announcing a release date for games until you know it’s guaranteed to be releasing then.@BlackMayge Been saying that for years now. All developers have do is follow the rule of 6 and they should be so golden.I can't wait to play Slime Rancher 2. That game has been on my radar forever.Never played Slime Rancher, sounds like people like it but damn that trailer made it look boring as hell. Is there more to it than sucking up slimes and putting them in cages or is the trailer just bad?@FakeSunkist Unfortunately there won't be a typical good window for the foreseeable. God of War, Calisto Protocol, Starfield, Forza 7, Redfall, Final Fantasy 16, Hogwarts legacy. Then you have quite a few potential hits like forspoken. Typical big hitters Cod, FIFA etc. There isn't really a good slot anymore.@funkhouser the trailer probably isn’t doing the game justice.The original Slime Rancher was a game I had no interest in until I sat and watched my kids playing it and it was so much better than what I expected.It’s still a lot about sucking up slimes. But there is a lot to explore in the world, secrets to find and so forth. So it’s actually more of an exploration game with collecting more than it is a farming sim or anything.@funkhouser I enjoyed playing it. It's a management game, you can sell their \"droppings\" in the market that flactuates over time and you can use your profit to upgrade your farms, house and equipment. I got addicted on the loop of playing it. I hope you can get to try playing it.The curse of 2022 delays strikes once again.A slight delay only I hope. Mike and Rich from Red Letter Media being in High on Life made me look forward to it.

This new 'Gameplay Overview' trailer goes into pretty much everything about the upcoming sequel, including Amicia's new moveset and the variety of locales you'll be visiting throughout your next journey.This one is looking very impressive, which isn't a huge surprise, given how good the first game was. A Plague Tale: Innocence was one of 2019's biggest surprises; a harrowing narrative adventure well worth anyone's time! (Unless you're petrified of rats, then, maybe not.)Here's a written overview of what to expect from A Plague Tale: Requiem when it hits Xbox Game Pass on October 18th:Embark on Hugo and Amicia’s next journey and venture south of 14th century France, before setting sail to a mysterious island out in the Mediterranean Sea. Brave a terrible fate and find a cure for Hugo’s illness thanks to Amicia’s new resources—including the use of alchemy to manipulate fire and the long-distance power of a crossbow, but also her cunning use of terrain and ability to wrestle out of an enemy’s grasp. Choose to strike from the shadow or to unleash hell, with the help of Hugo’s new powers: to perceive surrounding enemies’ movements while moving stealthily, and to manipulate hordes of rats to decimate entire squads of soldiers.Is this a day one play for you?

Looking forward to this, especially as it's on gamepassI didn't venture into the first until a sequel was announced and kicked my self for waiting so long ,one of the few games I'll play again after getting all the achievements,bring on the sequalAbsolutely cannot wait. The first game is brilliant.Looks like a big improvement over the first from a gameplay perspective. I just finished the first one not too long ago. Reminded me of how it felt to play TLOU, but slightly better all around.This just looks stunning and I can’t wait to get into it. Must play the first game properly beforehand though, it’s been on my backlog for way too long!Looks fantastic, definitely a day one play for me!Great get for Game Pass. I'll definitely be playing this game there.Yes Yes Yes, so looking forward to this my most anticipated release of this year, reminds me of TLOU 1+2 as well just finished playing them both and the first Plague Tale easily betters them gameplay wise i would say story wise probably on par with each other, I have high hopes for thisAs long as it doesn't suddenly run out, I have plans to buy my series x the day before this comes out and download it overnight. I cant waitI will be ALL OVER this game and Gotham Knights this fall. ALL OVER.@Royalblues now imagine if instead of putting it in game pass Royal, they just blocked it from other services instead of growing the audience and the value of their own service. Wouldn't you prefer that?!Looking forward to this. I wasn’t particularly interested in the first one - I mean, plague, rats and misery doesn’t sound all that enticing, but when I finally played it I really enjoyed it.Can’t wait for this lovely game I’m still playing my way through the 1st game so should tie in sweet as a nut.As much as I want to play this...I gotta get through the first game, and that's behind all the other games I'm into right now!! lol Tap here to load 14 commentsLeave A CommentHold on there, you need to login to post a comment...Two More Games Added To September 2022's Xbox Game Pass LineupAlong with news of a delaySome Notable Titles Are Leaving Xbox Game Pass This Month (August 31)10 in totalNew Lord Of The Rings Game Announced By 2K Publisher Private DivisionExpected to launch 2023-24Xbox Game Pass Is Hurting Right Now, But Larger Forces Are At PlayAll we need, is just a little patienceFour Games Are Confirmed For Xbox Game Pass In September 2022 So FarUpdate: Make that five!Game ProfileTitle:A Plague Tale: RequiemSystem:Xbox Series X|SAlso Available For:PS5Publisher:Focus Home InteractiveDeveloper:Asobo StudioGenre:Action, AdventureRelease Date:Xbox Game Pass (Subscription)Xbox Series X|SWhere to buy:Pre Order on Amazon \n",

Putting a date on and opening up preorders for Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed feels like an out of body experience, and we cannot wait for everyone to feel the same sensation on Tuesday, October 18.”Original story (Tue 22nd Mar, 2022): The developer behind the Friday the 13th and Predator: Hunting Grounds games has announced a brand-new Ghostbusters title called Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed, and it's hitting Xbox consoles in Holiday 2022.Like the aforementioned games, Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed takes the form of a 4v1 asymmetrical multiplayer title where four of you are the Ghostbusters, and one of you is the ghost. The game features character customisation tools, traditional and unique gear and weapons, voice acting from the likes of Ernie Hudson and Dan Aykroyd, cross-platform play, the ability to utilise AI-controlled companions to fill teams, and much more.The idea is that it's an all-ages game, rather than something more adult-focused like Friday the 13th.Look out for Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed on Xbox One, Series X and Series S later this year!As a Ghostbuster, join with other Ghostbusters to chase and trap ghosts in museums, prisons, hotels, and more, and capture the ghosts before they can fully haunt the areas.Or, as the Ghost, hide, sneak, surprise, scare, and of course, slime Ghostbusters and civilians until the everything has gone completely spooky. Use trickery, deception, and Ectoplasm to gain the upper hand and drive the Ghostbusters out.Liking the look of Ghostbusters: Spirits Unleashed so far?

I had hoped it was more a Single Player game with a great story. I wouldn't mind this as an 'online' mode as part of an online suite but doubt I'd use it often...this will be dreadful then, a truly awful devloper.better as mentioned giving this license to a company thats good and too single playerSuper, huge, major Ghostbusters fan. But I'm not even the least bit excited about this gameDeveloper's ratings on metacriticDead alliance (2017): 43Friday the 13th: (2017): 53Predator hunting grounds (2020): 56 (ps4)Star Citizen (2021) 33 <- only userreviews though (pc)Arcadegeddon (2021) 70 <- two reviews (ps5) userreviews 46 (7 ratings)This does not bode well for this game....I've played Dead by Daylight a bit which is this kind of game, and I can see how something like that could be good fun with Ghostbusters. Likely a lot less violent too I wish they would nail this, but history does not lend much hope.If it comes to gamepass I might try it. I liked the Friday the 13th game even though I prefer single player games. Not much hope for this one.Oh well single player story campaign would have been nice love me some original Ghostbusters, this is just not a game recipe I like though and we have seen a LOT of them lately, but many do enjoy this game template so it's good for themReminds me of that Luigi's Mansion game in Nintendo Land..I'm guessing Bill Murray couldn't be bothered?Zero interest in a multiplayer game. Ridiculous it’s Not single player.the only game i will buy in the same kind is evil dead.F13 had a fun loop, but man, that had more bugs than a bushtucker trial. Hopefully they've worked harder at ironing them out this time.

Would it be better to wait for the \"remastered\" or whatever version to be on sale?@Lup It was a zero effort remaster, the only major difference is the amount of GS. Original has 400GS and the new has 1000GS. There is a resolution bump too but both versions run at 30fps.@ShiguruiThanks for the answer! Not much of a reason to wait then.

Well, the game has cropped up once again via a bunch of Amazon storefront listings, including on Xbox Series X and Xbox One.The listing in question went live today, August 18th, although pre-orders are closed for now with the game deemed 'Out of Stock'. Still, there are some fresh screenshots included, and a potential release date to go on.We can no longer spot an attached launch date on the listing itself, although Wario64 says Dead Island 2 is set to release on February 3rd, 2023. We could be in for another busy Q1 next year!Dead Island 2 was first revealed way, way back in 2014, and the game has gone through multiple developers since that stage. UK team Dambuster Studios is now at the helm, for what appears to be the game's final development stretch.Are you looking forward to Dead Island 2? Or has it been too long at this point?

I like zombie games, albeit I've never played Dying Light.I enjoyed the first two games, but this is an entirely different team and has spent nearly a decade in development, so I have no idea what to expect.It will be interesting to see how it's changed from the original gameplays. It would also be cool to get a vidoc about what happened with this game during its dev hell.I don't hold out much hope for this. Its development has been handed off to different studios twice now (from Yager to Sumo Digital in 2015, then to Dambuster in 2019) and that's never a good omen.Who do you voodoo b**ch 😎 loved dead island have fond memories of raiding suitcases, showing zombies how machetes work and warming them up with a tasty molotovPlease be goodI'm so looking forward to this game, and have been since way back when they showed that quite stunning CGI trailer. I know it wasn't gameplay, and that the game has been in a kind of limbo since then, plus changed Development teams a number of times, but I'm really hoping that it'll be good. I also know that I will likely pre-order it, though I will probably do so just a few days before it is released so that I have a better idea as to its quality. Fingers crossed, though. Fingers crossed....I have been wanting this game for years. I loved the original and the expansion Riptide. I have played through both games multiple times. I just hope this game keeps the original formula that made the first two games so much. Do not try to turn this into Dying Light which sucks. Something changed with Dying Light other than adding parkour. It just was not as much fun. I love Dead Island and Dead Island Riptide. Did not care for Dying Light 1 or 2.All I gotta say is, I hope it doesn't feel outdated.

Six months on, and we're now a week out from launch, with early reviews beginning to hit the web.So, here's a roundup of some early reviews for Atlus' new JRPG, Soul Hackers 2.I wandered into Soul Hackers 2 expecting a general sense of quality from Atlus, and ended up getting sucked into its world. While dungeon design can feel samey at times, it’s not enough to distract from the flashiness of the game as a whole. As usual, Atlus really nails the details; it was fun to hang out with this crew and see where things went.Overall, Soul Hackers 2 is a great new entry to the SMT franchise, offering enough differences from its comrades that it doesn't feel like the exact same game. With its wonderful cast of characters, Soul Hackers 2 delivers a story that shows plenty of heart as well as heartbreak, with a theme that resonates with today’s world. Despite the bland dungeons, the combat is more than satisfying enough to make up for it, and the music is just a bonus to an already stylish game. If there’s an itch to play an SMT game, Soul Hackers 2 is sure to scratch it.Soul Hackers 2 feels like a budget title whose developers did the best with what they had. It's still a solid game with plenty to love that fans of the genre will certainly enjoy. A strong addition to the Shin Megami Tensei franchise with great combat and art direction only held back by uninspired dungeons and exploration.Soul Hackers 2 is a competent Atlus JRPG that will tick a lot of boxes for fans of the genre, but it falls well short of being that next breakout star from Japan. With awful dungeon design and little else to do outside of them, it falls upon the engaging combat system and interesting enough narrative to pick up the pieces. It's by no means the next must-play JRPG, but there's just enough to Soul Hackers 2 that warrants a playthrough.Soul Hackers 2 is, at its heart, a streamlined Atlus JRPG, serving as a great entry point for anyone new to the genre or the developer in general. The combat and dungeon delving are entertaining, if fairly familiar, and the charming cast of characters kept me interested all the way through its roughly 60-hour campaign. But a disappointing lack of creativity in its battle systems and a fairly shallow overarching story mean this newly resurrected series will need to do more if it wants to set itself apart amongst Atlus’ best.Taken as a whole, however, Soul Hackers 2 is a mostly satisfying experience. The character interactions and stylish art help it stand out from the pack, and the smooth-flowing, fast-paced combat makes even some of the more annoying dungeons (I don't want to see another abandoned subway for a very long time) feel like less of a drag. Soul Hackers, as a series, has a lot of potential to further grow into its own unique experience the way Persona has. Soul Hackers 2, despite its flaws, is a very promising start.Throughout the 30 hours it took to hit credits, I kept trying to latch onto the elements that work. Soul Hackers 2’s saving grace lies in its main characters, each with a distinct personality that often clashes with the rest. Witnessing the group’s growth by putting their differences aside and opening themselves up to camaraderie was a joy. I loved their conversations about freelancing as Devil Summoners as much as the tough chats about the people they lost over a meal or a drink. But there’s not a seat on the table for the player to take it all in.It's looking pretty good for Soul Hackers 2 then, even if it doesn't appear to be blowing anyone's socks off. The game is sitting at a respectable 77 on Metacritic, at the time of writing anyway!Will you be jumping into this Xbox JRPG at launch next week?

Hopefully the story and combat is good enough to keep me interested.I got through the dungeons of digimon cyber sleuth so I should be fine 😂interesting that almost every reviewer mentions that the dungeons aren't great...Super exciting for this game. Can’t wait  I’ve heard the music is also really good.@UltimateOtaku91 it’s by the TMS team; I don’t remember the dungeons being interesting there either but the combat was the stand out.@mousieone I loved Tokyo mirage session, I agree the combat was great in that so that makes me more confident in getting this day one. Still need to finish SMT V as well.Hopefully though this game isn't as long as Tokyo mirage sessions or persona.@mousieone on a separate topic, I've seen you online playing that new Ai game, is that any good? From the trailer it looks good but I've yet to play the first game so I don't know if I need to play that before the new one?Only thing that's stopped me from playing the first one so far is that's its supposedly 40 hours long, and I don't know if I can play a visual novel that's that lengthy@UltimateOtaku91 first off @NEStalgia will love you because NES loves TMS as well. I like parts of it but Tsubasa can do anything with a pep talk gets on my nerves aka the story. I love most everything else about the game minus the tact on FE bits .. it’s not as long as Persona but TMS is 30 hours as so is this. Maybe you meant SMT V?I love both Ai games. So does @SplooshDmg Technically you don’t need to play the first one to play this one. It makes you answer some questions and if you get them wrong it takes the spoilers out of the game. That said I think you get more out of it playing both. I don’t think either was 40 hours. The first one is a little longer than the second because the second has that hidden extra part for the Nonary games. Think my play times was 30 for the first and 20 for the second. I’m not a completionist. :3 the Ai Somnium games are like my top ten best ever games. They are visual novels with puzzles and QTEs and lots of fourth wall breaks @mousieone \"They are visual novels with puzzles and QTEs and lots of fourth wall breaks\"Now I'm interested, I can handle visual novels thare have extra things to do than just read, like zanki zero and the danganronpa series, but not digimon Survive 😂 the fighting in that just bored me.I suppose its on gamepass so I can give it a try and if I like it il get it on playstation or play the first gameAlso about TMS, it took me around 50 hours to do everything with the side quests and getting all weapons, SMT around the same but not finished yet, but yeah nothing compared to persona 5 Royal which took me 120 😬 but I did platinum it@mousieone @UltimateOtaku91 TMS#FE fans UNITE! <3...There's only like 5 of us so we have to stick together  I utterly love that game.I preordered SH2 2 days ago. I don't buy full priced games these days, I wait for sales even if it takes a year, and this doubtfully will sell terribly and hit sales sooner than later, but I just can't wait for this one for some reason, and the previews were good, and early reviews are exactly what I expected them to be, so I'm excited. At least PXB is (kinda) covering its existence here now LOL don't get us started on AI Som...did you miss how between me, Sploosh and Mousie we hijacked every PXB and Push thread for about a month and a half talking about it?  The first one is fantastic and is on GP. I'm holding off buying the second because it's sold terribly and I know it'll be dirt cheap sooner than later. I played 1 on GP but bought it on Switch for like $8 digitally, of course it's 3 years old. I'll probably get the second on XB when it hits a sale so my saves are all on one platform though.You're reminding me why I still have not played P5, and making me wonder if I REALLY want to start it come October..... that will consume my next calendar year. After already playing XC3, and SH2. Maybe a bit too much JRPG in one go.@NEStalgia I don't think reviews for this game are bad at all, the fact it's averaging a 7.5 is not bad at all for a jrpg, I'm still contemplating which version to get off the store, the premium edition is calling to me with all those extras but £75, a week before made in abyss, and splatoon 3 right round the corner and my partner wants fhe Disney Valley game 😩Wish they would include the extras with physical versionAbout Ai, I thought it was the second game that was on gamepass but I just Checked and it is the first one, so looks like I'm playing that one first.How you liking XC3? I'm currently on chapter 3 and 33 hours in, the maps are absolutely enormous, I think I've already explored more map than the entirety of Xc2. The game also feels a lot easier to level up, I'm currently level 36 yet the current story level is 27, only negative for me is the simplicity of the side quests compared to Xc2@UltimateOtaku91 AI: The Somnium Files / NirvanA Initiative and the first game are bona fide must play weeb games. They are utterly phenominal. NirvanA Initiative is probably my 2022 GOTY. If anything dethrones it, I will be shocked. NES, Mousie and I have basically hijacked several console war threads so far just talking about the first game. It's a thing we do.@UltimateOtaku91 Yeah, the one consistent negative point across reviews is bland dungeons, which, admittedly, for a dungeon crawler, is a pretty big negative, but it's generally where I expect any Devil Summoner subseries game to land in terms of scores, so I think it hits at the goal it was reaching for most likely.I went with the standard edition. I looked at the bonuses in the premium versions, and none of it spoke to me. They both have extra story, but from past Atlus games I've never found the extra story mission which is usually just a thinly padded extra-hard-bonus-boss, to be worth it, and yeah, this is an expensive, expensive 6 month period for a Japanese games fan..... something had to be left on the floor somewhere, and I can buy the DLC later if I miss it. XC3, Splat3, SH2, Star Ocean, AI Som2, Diofield (maybe, maybe not, from the demo I may end up passing that by), and I know I'm forgetting things. That's quite the shopping cart.Disney Val - [INSERT COIN] Yeah, definitely play AI Som 1 while it's on GP. Very much worth it! And we look forward to the next few weeks of PXB/Push threads being derailed by AI Som discussion as a result lol!I'm loving XC3 so far. I think I'm level 32 at this point, I'm not even sure what chapter I'm in, I keep going off on side quests that lead to other side quests that have level 40 monsters and I think the main quest requires level 26 or something where I am, so we're probably in roughly the same place post-Lambda. It's addictive, hours pass by in minutes. I'm just worried that the game is a little too easy to level up. I seem to be unlocking shedloads of levels and content so I worry I'm sailing through it faster than I wish. The side quests definitely feel a little simplified, and quick to complete, but OTOH XC2 had the problem that most of the side quests you pick up can't be done until late in the game, and some quests depended on completing other quests, but it never told you they did, and you could miss too many quests by simply not being in the right place at the right time, so it's an improvement in that regard. Poor Monolith just can't figure out how to get sidequests right.@SplooshDmg Thread: Microsoft!! Xbox!! Game Pass! Jim Ryan!!Us: DAAATEEEEEE!!BTW you ever see the Famitsu interview with the devs? It's hilarious (and spoiler filled.) When they're talking about how the Lemniscate secretary came to be, I realized who Date's personality was modeled after @NEStalgia Them - \"PS is evil!\"\n",
      "Also Them - No! Xbox is Evil!\"US - \"This game traumatized me, and I can't stop playing it!\"Lol no. I'll have to find that video. I love how many cameos of the first game that the second game is filled with. Guh, I can't wait for you to play it.@SplooshDmg LOL! That's really the best description I can think of for that game.I ALMOST bought it full price weeks ago, but knowledge that I'm just tossing money away for a game that'll hit good sales soon stopped me. And there's just soooo much to play on the way I'll never get to anything.@NEStalgia Yeah, I was initially going to hold off, but I was pretty happy to just give them the $60. I absolutely loved the game, and they can have my money. I was really worried the twist would get spoiled for me by the time the price came down. Saving a few bucks just wasn't worth the risk.Crappy dungeons are disappointing considering both SMT V and P5R featured great level design in their own ways. I'll wait to pull the trigger on this. Especially since I expect the price of this to drop like a rock in a few months anyway.

'Vault 32' has been built using practical props, and it's looking very Fallout-y thus far!As far as we know, this is the first proper look at an iconic 'Fallout Vault' for the show, as Amazon continues to develop the series. Filming began in early July, and at present, we don't have a projected release date for it just yet.Video game TV show adaptations have become incredibly popular over the last few years. HBO is currently developing a The Last of Us series, not to mention the huge popularity of Netflix's rendition of The Witcher. We're hoping this Fallout TV effort lives up the the hype!Will you be tuning into the Fallout TV series? Let us know down below.About Ben KerryBen is a fan of action, racing and straight-up shootin' in any video game he can get his hands on. When he's not gaming, Ben spends his time listening to way too much Guns N' Roses, watching football and probably eating somewhere.Comments (7)In terms of production value, I think the show is better in the hands of Amazon rather than Netflix. And it seems they have some people from Westworld involved here so I'm sure it will look great. Will be interesting to see how the story and casting works out.Talking about TV gaming shows, quoting some, and not even mention Halo TV Series by Paramount, that means something....🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣Crawl out through the fallout baby..you know what I meanLooking forward to this like what little we have seen so far@GASEOUS 😬😬😬What’s everybody’s take on the Halo tv series? I’ve watched all 9 episodes and I really enjoyed it. It was slow going by building up to the discovery of the Halo ring but I already can’t wait for season 2 when they’ll surely be landing on the Halo ring itself with all the Forerunner structures and lush lands, rivers, waterfalls etc.@MaccaMUFC definitely didn't enjoy it, couldn't pass episode 4, why you ask? Cause I didn't feel like it was Halo, how they lead with some characters and concepts just didn't feel it was \"A new take on the Halo universe\", it really looks more like a sci-fi tv series that wants to do its own thing but with some little Halo concepts throwing here and there, also the plot/premise was kinda mid actually.@MaccaMUFC the screenshots and scenes that some shared with me also didn't incentivize me to move on with the series hahaha, but I do have to admit that the acting was good to me and the visuals are superb, this aspect was simply GREAT to me.

Hosted by 44 Bytes.Soapbox: We Need More Light-Hearted Spin-Offs Like Immortals Fenyx RisingGuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpC'mon, lighten up!AAA games love to take themselves incredibly seriously. Sometimes it works out and matches the tone of a certain title or series, but at other times, it comes across as trying a little bit too hard. To be honest, I feel like we just need more self-aware stories in AAA gaming, generally.One such example is Ubisoft's Immortals Fenyx Rising, which is about to hit Xbox Game Pass later this month. Born out of development on 2018's Assassin's Creed Odyssey, Immortals created its own lighter-in-tone spin on the company's own open world formula, and it worked.Stylistically it was compared to Nintendo's Zelda: Breath of the Wild, a comparison that doesn't get thrown around every day. It then added a light-hearted sense of humour on top of that, and benefitted from such a direction. The fact that it was also a new IP helped proceedings as well; Immortals wasn't caught in any long-standing series lore that could manifest as additional weight.In fact, Ubisoft has done this a few times before, remember Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon? Sure it was a pseudo expansion to Far Cry 3, but its 80's action hero theme and ridiculously over-the-top nature suited Far Cry to the ground. It's a series that's always played with just pure messing about, and in essence, Blood Dragon is the most 'Far Cry' game in the series.Usually, this sort of stuff gets saved for DLC packs and crossover events in AAA gaming. Call of Duty has had its fair share of horror crossovers in recent years (yes, Scream Deathmatch was a thing) and that's all fine and dandy but feels like a bit of a missed opportunity. I mean, I'd play a first-person Scream slasher, with all of the movie's signature humour in place, within the CoD engine, wouldn't you?I suppose the crossover craze is likely to provide these less-serious offerings in the future; it's a trend that certainly doesn't seem to be slowing down. However, titles like Immortals Fenyx Rising and Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon show it can be done as a full release and still retain the same level of engagement. Halo but you play as a tiny screaming grunt trying to murder ridiculously-tall Spartans? Okay, why the hell not?!What game series would you like to see drop a tongue-in-cheek spin-off? Give us your ideas down below!About Ben KerryBen is a fan of action, racing and straight-up shootin' in any video game he can get his hands on. When he's not gaming, Ben spends his time listening to way too much Guns N' Roses, watching football and probably eating somewhere.Comments (35)Yes we absolutely need more games like this! It’s a terrific adventure that’s wonderful to look at and explore, and has just enough silliness to keep it kinda light. Awesome game.I thoroughly enjoyed this game, and despite comparisons, some general silliness in-game, and the odd questionable design choice, it's one of my fave open world games from Ubi.It must have passed me by this one but going to play it on gamepass.Loved this game - I loved AC Odyssey too which I found much more light hearted than Valhalla which takes itself way too seriously.The constant narrative bickering between Zeus and Prometheus is often pretty funny and sets the story well, while also being pretty educational as they discuss Greek myths and legends with their own opinions on them.Honestly one of the most fun games I've played, had me hooked from the start - I didn't click with any of the DLCs but the main game is entertaining, bright and a great chill out (gliding out from the main base gives a great view as well as being relaxing)Play a scream slasher with its signature humour?... Talk about 'one and done' games. Maybe I'd play it to unlock Courtney Cox's scream 3 fringe skinI’ll be controversial and say I enjoyed Fenyx more than BOTW, I just found it fantastic. It looks gorgeous, the combat was on point and I loved the puzzles, even the story was fun. I thought I’d find it annoying but it was actually quite charming I found.We definitely need more spins offs like that, instead of remakes and the 15th game in a series.It was super fun! The first DLC I was into but the rest, meh, all good though. Waiting for the sequelGlad that other people liked it, but I found the humor to be incredibly not funny to the point that it made the game substantially worse.Great topic!In a wider sense, I would love to see more light-hearted art (movies, games, books, etc).In gaming, I see many, many games that are \"trying a little bit too hard\" (yes, TLoU, I am looking at you!).Immortals was a breath of fresh air, even if the humour isn't everybody's cup of tea. But the effort, especially coming from Ubi, was very much welcomed and it showed that the developer still doesn't run out of ideas.I certainly would love to see a sequel and I hope all the troubles within Ubi do not affect the development of new IP's.Top 3 game for me that year. Hope they make a second one.@Hutchieace It's one sexy game and all the dlc too@J_Mo_Money they are 👌🏻@Fenbops I found botw totally boring and most of the time aimless wandering around doing boring dungeons@HarmanSmith At least in the movie business, almost half the blockbuster movie industry is Marvel now and it is consistently light-hearted.Totally agree. Gaming, since Western gaming took over the scene, has become one giant grimdark disaster porn experience where gamers seem to love nothing more than embracing despair at all times. Even the PS360 era's \"serious\" games were more 'action flick\" than \"arthouse depression-causing nightmare\" other than anything Final Fantasy. But the tone of modern gaming has become that if it doesn't make you feel miserable by the time you're done, it's not a serious adult game. (I say this as I play Xenoblade that's sole purpose is to shatter your ability to feel, mattering not at all what friendpon say.)Fenyx was my favorite game of Winter 2021, and one of my favorite games of the decade. It was just a fun, enjoyable, light, cometic thrill with beautiful scenery and fun gameplay.To be honest, I'm not always a fan of Nintendo-ish games. Not in the sense of similar to BOTW like some people call this one, but I mean way too happy and innocent.Having said that, I had this one on my list for a long time. Say what you want, but I love Ubisoft open-world games. And this one looks fun to me.\n",
      "I'm super happy it's coming to Game Pass.\n",
      "Blood Dragon was fun from beginning to end.Breath of the Wild is the most overrated game in history and also the worst The Legend of Zelda 3D game.I played this on XSX shortly after getting the console (2020) but just like Assassin's Creed: Valhalla, had that annoying save game sync issue and random crashes. Hope they've fixed it now. Ubi has a tendency to stop support real quick with their games.One of my favorite game of last year , played on the switch and will surely double dip on my series s when it comes to gamepass.The base game was pretty fun. The humor was great (but i get it, it's not for everyone) and the gameplay was extremely fun. I didn't like the DLC that much. I agree we need more of these kind of games. So i hope Ubisoft will keep more of these kind of games, i generally like their games.One of the reasons I've been loving a lot of indie games over the last few years is for this very reason. They actually seem to have a sense of humour. Devolver Digital published games especially.@Widey85 I loved Valhalla, but you're right, it did take itself a little too seriously lol. I just wish they'd do feudal Japan for god's sake. It would make one hell of a great fit and would feel completely different to what's come before.Definitely a game I'd be interested in trying on Game Pass as it didn't do 'enough' for me to consider a Purchase at launch. In fact, its got to the point now where a game has to do a LOT more now to convince me to purchase at/near launch than ever before - not because of Game Pass, but because of price increases, state of games at launch and even the 'artstyle' can look 'cheap' too.Its a case of being bitten too many times - trusting the marketing, trusting what the devs tell you and trusting the Publisher to release games 'WHEN' they are ready and NOT before. In some cases, you also have to trust that the 'content' you expect and have already paid up front for, will end up matching expectations. Quite a few games now 'promise' content over time and the 'base' content is not worth the admission fee at launch.None of that really matters with Game Pass. Maybe this was 'worth' the asking price but for whatever reason, it didn't convince me it was. If/when it comes to Game Pass, I won't be looking at it from the perspective of 'I have invested 'X' money into this, it better deliver that 'value' or more to me in return'. I'll be looking at it from the perspective of does it interest me enough to try this 'now' and then let the game dictate how much of my time it occupies - the better, the more engrossed, the more immersed, the more I enjoy, the more 'time' it will fill.If its 'not great', or it doesn't appeal to me, all I have lost is a bit of time - not time & Money!. This is also why its more important for Game Pass games to have extremely high player engagement - doesn't matter if its not the 'best' looking games - those made to hype you on Visual quality and get you to spend 'Big' money for 'mediocre' game-play. If GP games don't engage their audience, or become pretty but shallow, people will stop Subscribing and go back to 'buying' whatever other games interest them. Its perhaps more important to devs/publishers to ensure their games are 'quality' when they do go into game-pass because if people try and move on quickly, then they won't 'maximise' their return, gamers won't purchase or persuade others to try - easier to convince someone to try a 'free' game than to try something they have to fork out £50 for...Anyway, as I said, I'll probably try this and make up my own mind about whether its a game 'worth' playing to the end or not but it was a game that didn't do enough to convince me to buy - even at sale prices...Wholeheartedly agree! Bit of a tangent, but one of the reasons I have such fondness for Nintendo games, apart from what seems to be an ethos of encoding joy into their core gaming experiences, is they seem largely exempt from the data- and money-grabbing most contemporary games are designed around. It's absolutely refreshing to play a title like Kirby which doesn't make you read through 17 pages of privacy waivers, or ask you to create an account, or show you what's new on the store before each play session. A game's lightheartedness is compromised to varying degrees by the extent to which it does this. Immortals Fenyx Rising is a wonderful game, but it's also an Ubisoft game, which means it comes freighted with a fair amount of this transactional, anti-game poppycock (pardon the language). In this era of access to classic games via Nintendo Switch Online, PS Plus and xbox back compat, it's both shocking to see how much better games have gotten, and disheartening to see how much has been sacrificed by exposing games to the corrupting influence of monetization and data-gathering. I do miss the purity of that old feeling of dropping into a game knowing that every trace of the real world has been walled off by this hand-made interactive experience, a space where data-driven engagement metrics and capitalist, transactional progression models have not yet encroached, before every game company had its hands in our pockets while ours were busy with controllers.@BAMozzy My friend, you may be watchful with your money, but I love how generous you are with those single quotes, and I have come to partake in your 'largesse'...I find your viewpoint interesting because it runs counter to my experience. I'm a long-time Game Pass subscriber and find it great value for money. But a survey of my gaming history shows that when credits roll on a title, more often than not I have purchased it, rather than accessed it through one of my subscriptions. Perhaps it's just capitalism thoroughly baked into my psyche, but the game ownership dynamic seems to tether me more closely to a title and make it harder for me to move on from. Does that mean I'm having superior gaming experiences? Absolutely not. It could very well imply that I'm spending time on games I otherwise wouldn't simply because I threw some currency at them.Anyway, I appreciate your perspective and thoroughly agree that substance over style will ultimately determine the success of any game and therefore any subscription service. The only game I've pre-ordered EVER is Horizon Forbidden West, and while I fully believed in the hype of that game because of the studio behind it and my experience playing the original, there was the added incentive of $10 off the launch price due to Sony's botching the PS5 upgrade path. I do love sticking my head out the window of a fast-moving hype train, but healthier by far to ignore the promises of marketing departments and gauge reactions from critics and fellow gamers before opening your wallet.@Banjo- Breath of the Wild is probably my favorite game of all time? But, like any game, I can see why it's not for everyone. I'm curious... what are your top 5? Just to give your comment some context.@HarmanSmith Ubisoft did seem to have abandoned one of gaming's most absurd and entertaining creations: Rayman. How wonderful it was to see a title like Fenyx emerge from the murderous diamond mine that Ubisoft have become. They were capable of incredible humor and creativity in the past, so it was quite refreshing to see that flame not entirely snuffed out within their stable of studios.@nofriendo Everyone is an individual with their own unique views, opinions, values etc so things like Subscription vs Purchase will have a different impact to everyone. Some may find that they use Game Pass to 'try before they buy', knowing what they are getting, that they are 'enjoying' what was offered and willing to buy to support the Devs a bit more than Game Pass does and also know that you can 'replay' anytime whether you are still subscribed and /or the game remains in that service or not. Also you may want to 'buy' with the 20% discount when it leaves too as its much, much cheaper by then and you may of invested money in DLC etc too.There are games that I play through, get to the end and delete having enjoyed my time. But knowing its not something I'm going to play again, not going to buy - but I've still supported the dev as they got money from me playing (maybe more if I finished the game as I hear they also offer a player engagement 'bonus' as one of the options for devs/publishers negotiating terms with MS) and its 'more' money than they would have received had I not played the game at all - because I wasn't going to buy it...I would never buy games like the Great Escape, the Medium, The Gunk etc so they would of got 'nothing' from me - even in a sale. Now they got money because I played the game to completion on Game Pass. If this comes to Game Pass too, that's some more money coming from me that they wouldn't have received otherwise and it may lead to a purchase - maybe the game and/or DLC too.I am someone who much prefers to buy Physical - I love opening up a brand new case, looking at the artwork and putting it on my shelf along with all my other discs. I'm someone that would buy a Disc to 'keep' playing over the Digital version too. But with the way gaming is going, it may well be better now to invest in Digital games - especially if BluRay drives become obsolete on new consoles.Still each to their own - we are all individuals with our own preferences, budgets, circumstances and of course lifestyles (which affects the amount of gaming hours people have too). All of that factors in and why something may impact another differently to yourself...@nofriendo That will take a long time to figure out but I will list my three favourite The Legend of Zelda games for now: Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask and Twilight Princess.@Banjo- Man, I almost agree with you.I don't know if it's the most overrated (maybe I wouldn't go that far), but everytime I think of BOTW I get a strong sense of discomfort!I sure see the quality in it, but it just didn't click with me. It felt so obtuse, so \"un-Zelda\" (even if I respect the effort to try some new ground for the series) that I left it unfinished halfway through.Of course, I respect everyone who loves BotW so much. But it isn't for me.@nofriendo I sure miss Rayman.I can't understand, for the life of me, how the Rabbids (and I have nothing against them, mind you) are still moderately thriving but Rayman got canned almost a decade ago!Anyway, I hope Immortals gave Ubisoft's creativity a boost and we can see other titles in the same vein.@HarmanSmith Yep, Rayman Legends is brilliant! In regard to BoTW, I say the most overrated because of reviewers praising things that they wouldn't praise so much if it wasn't a Nintendo game and the delayed Wii U game for the Switch launch. I wrote a lot about it but basically there are many things that are almost broken or missing except the exploration which is fine if you don't mind the emptiness and disappearing deer.Of course, I respect people that love it but because of so much praise, I feel the urge to say my opinion as well.@Banjo- Certainly can't argue with that trio. Ocarina of Time... I'll remember what it felt like to play that game for all my living days. I rate Breath of the Wild higher because it is the only other game that's managed to recreate that feeling for me, only stretched out to 550 hours and counting. Is it a much different game? Absolutely. Does it feel like the reincarnation of the soul of Ocarina of Time, just in a different body? It does to this gamer.@nofriendo I agree with Banjo, OoT and Majora's Mask are great!But I can't say about Twilight Princess, because that's the only one of the TLoZ 3D games I haven't tried @nofriendo It's a totally different game but if you enjoyed it, that's what matters 😊.@HarmanSmith Nice! I hope you play Twilight Princess someday. The Wii U remaster is awesome.

As hinted at earlier this week, it's been confirmed that the 2019 Kojima Productions PC and PlayStation exclusive Death Stranding is officially coming to PC Game Pass on Tuesday, August 23rd.The publisher of this version is 505 Games, which had the following to say in a press release:\"The original version of Hideo Kojima’s critically-acclaimed and genre-defying epic lands on the Microsoft ecosystem for the first time, available to audiences who are subscribed to the PC version of Xbox Game Pass.\"\"DEATH STRANDING tells a groundbreaking story of perseverance through an emotional adventure that those in the Microsoft community can now experience for the first time.\"You'll be able to get hands-on with Death Stranding on PC Game Pass from 5pm PT / 1am BST on August 23rd, and it'll apparently be the \"original version\" - which suggests it won't be the \"Director's Cut\" edition released earlier this year.If you've never played Death Stranding before, it holds a very impressive 85 rating on Metacritic for PC, and is the most recent release from the Metal Gear Solid creator, Hideo Kojima, who also recently partnered with Xbox on a new game.\"From legendary game creator Hideo Kojima comes an all-new, genre-defying experience. Sam Bridges must brave a world utterly transformed by the Death Stranding. Carrying the disconnected remnants of our future in his hands, he embarks on a journey to reconnect the shattered world one step at a time.\"Excited for Death Standing on Xbox Game Pass for PC?

It’s still a sony first party IP. If it happens sony will probably bring something like spider-man over first similar to MLB the show.@darkswabber My dream, one day all games on one console on day of release from whatever owned studios 😊Just imagine turning that console onOne minute playing Mario Odyssey the next GOWR the next Forza Motor sport, all on day of release. That has surly got to be gamers heaven.That's cool. I'll give it a shot. I have a decent PC which I haven't put through the paces in a while.@Dezzy70 we're still a decade and a bit from that eventuality.@Dezzy70 no chance of a console release as sony are the publisher for consoles, its coming to pc as 505 games are the publisher for that version and can decide where it goes on PC. Though sony probably had a deal to atleast keep it on steam only for 12 months to maximise profits.Its funny though as over xbox sites and on twitter everyone was bashing this game when it first released, calling it a walking simulator and boring etc yet now everyone is looking forward to it just so they can rub it in lolPersonally though I haven't played it and don't plan to as ironically it is just a walking simulatorDon't get too excited about it. People either seem to love it or just not get it. I am the latter.@UltimateOtaku91 Absolutely I don’t like the game and never willNot one of Sonys best games.@Agnostic This. To me it was nothing but a snoozefest.@Royalblues Maybe one day it will happen. All three could share console sales profit etc. and the best games get the most purchased and money for that studio.I don't get why this game can come to PC Game Pass which is Microsoft but not Xbox Game Pass which is also Microsoft? Why not Xbox Game Pass?@UltimateOtaku91 It's not a walking simulator, it's a bat ***** crazy 'delivery' simulator! Very interesting when I put one console all games on all three websites. Pure Xbox, most positive response, probably because the Xbox eco system is the most advanced.Push square, silence or a little go at me.Nintendo Life, I need to hide and run before they kill me. They absolutely hate the thought of Nintendo games on anything else but a Nintendo designed and made console.Goes to show out of all three what fans are the most backward and fan boy ish. Real gamers would want one console all games day one on that console.@UltimateOtaku91 but you know how this works: A lot (not all, but a lot) of gamers bash Sony games as \"one & done\" & \"interactive movies\"...But as soon as the chance to play those exact games on their preferred device pops up...they all of a sudden become interested...PC not for me. Great news for others though.@Dezzy70 I think you're wrong on the reason for the responses to your \"One console - all games\" comment...Here's why:First of all, I think you'd agree that the people who post comments at these 3 sites are more hardcore & stay current on day to day gaming news...So of the hardcore commentors from all 3 sites, Xbox gamers seem to want games from the other consoles...more than PlayStation or Nintendo gamers want games from the other consoles.I saw Xbox GP in the title and my heart skipped a beat for a split sec, then read 'For PC'. They rebranded to PC GP just say that!It is a walking simulator. It really is. You even have to balance your body with the trigger buttons not to fall, etc.Gameplay-wise, it's really a strange experience.Story-wise, it's very... complicated. Nebulous.But also ? Fascinating, man. Really, really fascinating.I'm a Kojima fanboy, so what do I know. But after having finished it, I was like... \"Ok... So now... what am I thinking of it ? I'm not even sure to know myself. Have I liked it ? Loved it ? Or on the contrary... hated it ? Man, it's so strange...\"But you what ? Days later, MONTHS later... you still think about it. The all experience sticks with you. The landscapes, the story, the universe, those fu..ing deliveries... It all remains in your brain. Somehow, somewhere.And I think it's the mark of the truly great pieces of art.My advice : keep an open mind and try it. And try to finish it, even if it's to say, in the end, that you hated it.Man, what an experience.@Snake_V5 My understanding is that Sony is the publisher for console version, not for PC.Also, I'm not sure about it, but I think I've read somewhere that Sony itself is publishing its PC versions, now ? So if it's the case, a Death Stranding sequel would never follow this path and come to Gamepass.Personally i have little interest in the game but it does feel odd having it on an Xbox service. It's not Sony first party so it's not overly outlandish but still odd. Hope folks enjoy the game.@Dezzy70 I like Nintendo stuff being on Nintendo hardware….actually, i kinda like having three consoles with their own exclusives. Tho it does seem like there’s not much reason to own both Xbox and Ps5. Still enjoy both tho.@SplooshDmg Haha, OK then it's a Royal Mail simulator 😂@Dezzy70 It's a nice dream to have, however I'm not sure how it could work. Without any other hardware competition whoever made this device would have a monopoly and be able to charge whatever they wanted for it, with no incentive to make it the best it could be. If you want a great product, you need competition. I guess maybe you could have a system whereby different manufacturers could each make their own version of a console which had to be compatible with the same games, in the same way that Series X games have to be compatible with Series S, but then you're putting extra strain on the developers to setup and test custom profiles for each hardware configuration. And this also sounds quite like just having a PC.@Spaceman-Spiff They could share the console manufacturing wise and the profits. The competition is of course the games. If all three and all their studios are making for one console the game purchase competition will be massive. Only the best games will sell millions.Fortunately with Game Pass Ultimate, which combines all 3 Game Pass platforms (Console/PC/Cloud), will allow me to play this on my 3080ti Laptop should I wish. I could of bought it on PS4/5 or PC by now if I was that interested in it!!From a 'Sony' perspective, the Game has served its purpose. Any Console gamer desperate to play would of bought the game and a Playstation by now. Its even had a 'remaster' (of sorts) to encourage 'fans' to upgrade - now its hardly selling and this certainly won't negatively impact Sony.For PC gamers, they too have had ample time to 'sell' games and probably sales have dried up to. By putting it on Game Pass, they are 'inviting' all those PC gamers to play this game which in turn will bring in 'more' money for the devs/publishers and of course start another PR campaign - which may raise interest again on Sony's console - and get a few more sales there too...@Snake_V5 Because Sony is the console publisher for the game and 505 is the PC publisher for the game. Sony decides where the console release goes but not the PC release despite it being a first party IP and owning the engine in which it was built.@rockodoodle I think Nintendo IPs could be far better on stronger hardware. As much I really enjoyed and praise Mario odyssey and BOTW given the power Nintendo could make them even better. Better AI, more enemies on screen, imagine Hyrule with the series x power the environment and environment interaction etc would be outstanding.@uptownsoul I think that’s a fair observation. I have all 3, but to have one purchase one box all games day one is my gaming dream. My pure one box digital game fantasy.@Dezzy70 The reason all games on one console would be a bad idea is because there's be no console competitor. We've seen time and again how platform holders push their limits to see what they'd get away with. Like upgrade fees or online access double price increases. it's the outcry from gamers that force decisions to reverse but without competition why would they listen? Where else would console players go to get their games? There's no threat for the platform holders so they'd take the p**s.This game was sitting in my backlog on ps4/ps5 for years. I would much rather play it on my PC. I might actually get around to playing it now.@UltimateOtaku91 Basically. You walk, you drive vehicles, there's some weird ghostlike creatures, dead people explode, and you can even deliver the mail late! It's just like the real thing!@GADG3Tx87 Ok what if the console was licensed to all three but of course had to be the same specification at heart, then a gamer could chose what branded one to buy. So like Nintendo might make the console same specification but no blu ray movie player capability but it’s cheaper. Xbox might make one with blu ray movie player capability and cost more. Sony might make an all digital one, the cheapest. Competition is now there from a console point of view. The games competition is obvious, the best games will sell more.Damn MS really loves to waste millions on this wannabe movie director, hope they cancel the Xbox-Kojima gameHow many said it was boring and a walking sim, but are now hyped because it’s on Xbox?It’s a great game and a unique experience. I hope everyone tries it, regardless of past comments.@Dezzy70 the other HUGE problem with \"All games on all consoles\" is what one of Bethesda's head developers said:(paraphrase quote and I'll find & cite the source in a bit) - \"Focusing on less platforms allows us to make a better game\"If you believe what he says, and I generally do, then \"All games on all consoles\" will make all games watered down[EDIT]...here's the source from Todd Howard at Bethesda: https://www.pcgamer.com/todd-howard-says-focusing-on-fewer-platforms-will-mean-better-games/@Dezzy70 I agree, I have had to buy at least 2 platforms to play ALL the games I want. There is 'nothing' stopping MS, Sony or Nintendo from 'Publishing' games on the other platforms - except that would see their Hardware sales impacted. People would buy the Hardware that they 'prefer' for whatever reason - whether its game performance metrics, features, controller preference, UI preference etc.I think with Streaming options, that could become more a reality - a 'Console' that offers ALL games. If you 'prefer' Xbox (for example), you can play Sony/Nintendo games by subscribing to their streaming service, but cannot 'download' and/or play locally. Of course you can with Xbox games because they were designed and built for that hardware.For the 'Platform' holder, they are offering Local native versions of those games that you can download and play, Also games are often rotated so the other Platforms only get the 'streaming' list of games to play - not the full list. Maybe you can 'buy' games to 'keep' them accessible via streaming...It seems like there is going to be a platform with ALL the games in the 'near' future - PC's. PC's already have every 'new' Xbox game released on it day and date so don't 'need' to buy the console for 'exclusives'. Sony are releasing more and more games on PC themselves - acquiring Nixxes to port them. I know its not yet day and date, but if you are willing to wait a bit, then you could also skip buying a Playstation. You might need to buy a Switch for Nintendo games or find some 'emulated' versions...I'd much prefer to buy a Single platform to play ALL games. I've been in a position where I can buy multiple consoles, but spending £450+ for what amounts to an extra 2-3 games a year at most. I don't play EVERY exclusive because they don't ALL appeal - just like games in general. I have bought Spider-Man:MM Ultimate Edition, R&C and Horizon:FW since PS5 launched - I refuse to pay £10 to upgrade GoT or any of the 'other' games I already have on PS4 - so that's 3 games in 2 yrs that I couldn't play on my Series X. I know they have had more games (Deathloop, Ghostwire - both likely to be on Game Pass so I'll wait, GT7, Demon Souls, Returnal etc didn't appeal) but on average, its about 2 to 3 games a year 'Max' - the rest can be played on either. So for me, I'd love a one for all...As for the Fanboyism, I think that comes down to the 'average' maturity levels of their user base. Nintendo do appeal to a 'young' demographic - I know they appeal to a wide range of ages and obviously nostalgia plays a part too - but you are going to have quite a lot of young gamers. Sony seems more 'teenage/young adult' - still locked in that Console mentality whilst Xbox is more Adult/mature - They don't get annoyed about games releasing on PC, embrace things like cross-play etc.Of course all have a mix of ages so there are 'mature' gamers on all 3 platforms, but the majority (or should that be 'vocal' majority that frequent gaming sites) do tend to be different and that is evident by the fanboy balance and 'maturity' of the people running these sites - I'm sure that they contribute a LOT to that too - if their articles were more 'maturely' written and their comments/forums policed more maturely, then maybe it wouldn't be quite so evident!!I loved Death stranding Im no kojima fan boy but its was a strangely relaxing medative experience getting from A to B delivering stuff exploring the world and finding out what happened and who you and other are and their stories.A very rewarding experience@uptownsoul This is partly why I think that Cloud/Streaming Platforms will become the 'standard' in the future. You only need to build 'one' version of the game, made to run in the cloud with 'no' minimum spec hardware to set the 'baseline'. No porting and optimizing for multiple platforms and their OS and API's, no concerns over scaling up/down and/or targeting say visuals (higher visual settings) at the expense of Frame Rate (capped to 30fps) - you get the 'same' version running the same way on EVERY device (as long as your internet connection is consistently high enough)Xbox Cloud games are running on 'Virtual' Series X hardware built into servers. It doesn't matter whether you have just a Smart TV, mobile or 'cheap' student laptop (no discrete GPU and definitely not got the CPU or RAM performance to run it), even last gen Xbox consoles, PS4/PS5, Nintendo Switch - the last 2 if Sony/Nintendo allowed them) etc all play MSFS - a game that only released on PC and Series consoles.A 'server' could be built to be much more powerful than any domestic PC/Console could be - certainly in terms of affordability for the masses. Devs could utilise that to make games impossible to port/run on any hardware and stream to EVERY compatible device therefore making hardware platforms basically unimportant. It'll be like buying a TV and having every Game/TV/Movie/Music service apps available - you want to play Xbox games Subscribe to Game Pass, Sony games, subscribe to Playstation+ - indies and 3rd Party publishers who don't have their own service could release across several services at once..Of course, if/when it gets to that point, every device is a 'multi-platform' device. The platform stops being 'external' hardware we as gamers can buy, and becomes the 'app/service' we subscribe to.Sony fanboys gonna erupt over this@uptownsoul It’s one console only that plays all games. That would be a lot better.@uptownsoul Good point, perhaps that is why Nintendo and Sony normally get the best out of their hardware. They focus on just one bit of kit. Sony think about the PC conversation later down the line with usually a side studio undertaking that task.Xbox studios have to focus on series x and less powerful series s and also PC. Well done Todd glad someone at an Xbox studio said that, said that all along on here about Xbox studios have to focus on to much.Also I know what Todd meant by what he said, no PS5 or Switch.@BAMozzy Cloud/Streaming wont be the standard in our lifetime...Internet is too far behind@Dezzy70 One console makes sense...but business wise you got to ask, which 2 of the 3 console makers is gonna stop making consoles...If you're an open-minded person who likes bonkers stories with slow-paced, albeit challenging and rewarding, gameplay that sets itself apart from most modern games in over-saturated genres then you'll love Death Stranding.@Dezzy70 @GADG3Tx87 @Spaceman-Spiff There already is one box that has everything (except Nintendo). It's called PC. The only problem is it's super expensive and totally non-standard which shouldn't be a big problem. Really it could work a lot like what Steambox was supposed to be had Valve not totally blown it. Essentially an open spec of certified machines, so arguably Apple, Samsung, Sony, Huawei, Microsoft, Nintendo, Dell, HP, LG, Razer, could all try to offer their own hardware that meet the console spec and go through certification. The certification could be a committee made up of software publishers (MS, Nintendo, Sony, Embracer, EA, etc.) And that could unify PC/console for development purposes.Technically we should already have had that but Valve dropped the ball super hard on the Steambox. Otherwise there's the cloud future which is really going to be the main future anyway. Complete with subscriptions to every individual publisher like how TV works.........@uptownsoul I used to think cloud couldn't ever be standard, but that was until they built the gigantic poorly thought out 5G cellular network that nobody actually has a use or need for. And then the telcos intend to halt wired internet rollout and move everything to 5g saturation. It's a mess, BUT I do think over the decade/generation we're going to see cloud become a lot more viable in a lot more areas and the majority of \"casual\" gamers (which is like 80% of gamers) will migrate to that much cheaper ecosystem that works \"well enough\". I think we'll hit a point where we laugh at it, then accept is as an alternative for some, then one day wonder why it seems like all industry focus is on the streaming market and then realize that's because that's where most people play and the consoles are an increasingly expensive exotic niche nearing the end. It's happening in real-time, but we're in a bubble and not seeing it as immediately (even if we're actively doing it ourselves.)@Krzzystuff It kinda is Sony 1st party. They own the IP, even though Kojma develops it. But they sold the PC publishing rights originally. Now they have their own in-house PC focus but back then, they didn't.@Dezzy70 LOL! To be fair, Nintendo fan response might be a result of PTSD from that time the CDi got Nintendo games......  The argument has always been that Nintendo designing games for hardware other than their own will lead to a loss in quality, but inside the Switch is basically just an nVidia Shield with custom tuning. Their business model depends on the walled garden, but the hardware, starting with Switch, isn't particularly unique anymore other than it's form factor/controller setup.@SplooshDmg I thought that was called \"Prime\"?@Snake_V5 PC and XB Game Pass have different licensing, which is why they also have separate subscriptions (both are included in Ultimate.) There's games on PC that don't exist on console that are on PCGP, and some games on console that don't go to PC, etc. In this case, Sony publishes the PS console version, but contracted out to 505 to publish the PC version. And Kojima Productions never made an Xbox version so there isn't one that could appear on XBGP even if anyone wanted it to, and Sony owns the IP so Kojima never will make an Xbox version.@LtSarge Couldn't agree more with you.@Dezzy70 here is what i think will mostly likely happen within the next 5 years: there will always be exclusives, but it will become less common. most 1st party games will be TIMED exclusives. games like Spider-Man and maybe Gears, games that we know would sell like crazy, will go to the \"other\" platform 1-2 years after they release on their home console, basically when sales of the title begin to slow down on the home console. this would prop up sales and even help keep prices down (you wouldn't need to charge $70 if you know you can add 1-5 million more sales this way). fans would still stick with their preferred console because they'd get to play these games first, but ultimately, as game production budgets get bigger and bigger, full permanent exclusivity will make less and less sense. Hell, Companies would already be doing this if they weren't so sure we'd whine and cry about it lol@NEStalgia The only Prime that matters is Metroid.@uptownsoul Not really. You don't need 'crazy' internet bandwidth to play games via streaming. Its already at a point where playing games via streaming adds 'imperceptible' lag - maybe a few ms slower, but that's not too bad.Internet standards are improving all the time. When PSNow had streaming on other devices, inc my Smart TV app, a lot were still on dial-up, up to 8Mb/s but now, most can stream 4k Netflix which has a higher bandwidth requirement than 1080/60 Game Pass. Now I know that 1080p with compression artefacts is not as good as Native Series X can offer, but it can still offer 'better' than playing Native on last gen hardware.In the UK, there is a push for High Speed Internet coverage 'everywhere' - inc Fibre Optic to the house - not just to the nearest junction box. 5G is becoming the standard in mobiles now and no doubt that will evolve. WiFi too is evolving. A lot of countries do seem to have plans to improve and increase their High Speed Internet coverage - raising the 'minimum' acceptable speeds across the whole country. In the UK, they expect gigabit broadband to be available 'nationwide' by 2030 and in the US, a new proposal by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel, the minimum broadband speeds in America would be raised to 100 Mbits/sec down and 20 Mbits/sec up - that's more than ample to stream any game at 4k...MS has its own 'cloud' publishing department. These are for games built specifically to run in the cloud 'only' - Kojimas project was rumoured to be cloud based because 'local' hardware cannot do what he envisions.If people will buy a Switch to play 'worse' versions of 'great' games on the go, then the'll likely to subscribe to streaming to play much better looking and running versions on their 'mobile' devices. Some 540p upscaled to 720p and capped to 30fps with 'low' visual settings to play 'locally' on Switch or play at 1080/60 high visual settings via streaming for less money...If the new games like CoD, Fifa, Tomb Raider, GTA etc are only released on a streaming platform, then people will also subscribe. It has a LOT of benefits or the dev/publisher - like not having to worry about the 'weakest' spec in their design, not having to port the game to various different platforms and get them working with their OS/API's, no distribution or manufacturing costs reducing development costs without reducing quality. You are literally making just 1 game for a single platform and that one version being the same quality/standard for ALL customers - instantly available, no need to wait hours to download, install or update and of course no risk of Piracy, mods/cheaters etc either...@armondo36 Very good theory that could be an alternative.@NEStalgia The PC as you even said does not do Nintendo Also it does not do all games Playstation and not on day one. I mean one box true console style.@uptownsoul None they could all release a console with same heart specification and gamers choose their preferred brand and controller. But maybe different varieties. Nintendo, no blu ray 4K playerXbox, digital onlySony, With blu ray 4K playerSort of like that you get the idea.Still probably won’t play this. This game disturbed me from the first trailer.@SplooshDmg Doesn't matter which Prime it is. You know it's indefinitely delayed either way!Kojima game just do nothing for me.@BAMozzy being a viable alternative is not the same as being the standard... Every time the internet takes a step, so does our games...The gap between out internet speeds & how demanding our games will remain too big for streaming to be \"the standard\"@Dezzy70 maybe I am just old school, but part of Nintendo’s magic is their quirky way of doing things….it’s not the best example by any means, but it just feels awkward playing Nintendo stuff on other devices like Mario Kart Tour or the Mario runner.Granted, I agree with you in that the device is feeling dated and is due for at least a pro model soon. OTOH, I feel like the longer we wait, the better the specs will be for the next gen system….@uptownsoul I don't disagree there are still gaps in internet capability that makes streaming have a varying degree of issues in a varying degree of locales for the moment. But what do you mean by \"the gap between speeds and how demanding games\" are? PS15 games will use exactly the same bandwidth as PS3 games use at the same output resolution and audio quality, which is close to what Netflix and Hulu use as well, or doubled for framerate difference (24fps film vs 60fps, 120fps games etc.) It's just a video stream with byte-level inputs, and technologies are evolving specifically around streaming games to make it more and more feasible.Boring as it was, did you watch Verizon's E3 presentation last year? It wasn't bout console cloud streaming or whatnot so much as it was about mobile gaming, but the tech being described was still an interesting insight into what the future of gaming in a cloud future might look like. The TL;DR of it is they're building out (mostly for mobile for now, and only for wireless, not wired for now) local processing capability at the cell tower level, so that things like inputs etc can be processed at the local tower level without having to go out on the backhaul. Or to simplify it a bit more \"cloud gaming, where part of the \"console\" is local on your tower and processing some of the netcode etc for play locally. Or bringing the \"cloud\" physically closer to your point of use, for the most critical, time-sensitive pieces.Again, that's not widespread, it has nothing to do with console cloud gaming for the most part yet, etc, it's a specific thing aimed at competitive play largely on mobile devices. But it's a preview of the KIND of tech that's going to be increasingly implemented across the telco networks that will facilitate improvements to what we think of as \"cloud\" play in the future. It absolutely will evolve in directions we tend not to think about based on traditional \"I'm in NY and the cloud server is in LA, and that's how long the input takes.\"Cloud is here, it's going to keep improving and growing and a LOT of money is being invested into the infrastructure to make it happen. There's no question eventually we hit a point where most people, the casual market, which is most of the market, will find it good enough and cheap enough to play on \"rented\" hardware, and the industry will align with that shift. IDK if it'll be next gen or 5 gens from now, but it'll happen. And it'll leave behind people in the wrong postal codes that don't have the best access, and yes, that really sucks, and Nintendo will probably still make a device that works for them, lol.@NEStalgia what you're pointing to is a viable alternative...which I agree can be close...But \"the standard\"...is still a long, long time from now.@rockodoodle the Switch pro controller is basically just an Xbox controller with gyros and a mirrored button mapping.... IDK if it feels any different to play on that than on an Xbox tbh.What I worry about with Nintendo, though, is they keep their hardware quirky, sideways, and therefore underpowered, and their games are tailored around lower budget dev costs where the limitations of the hardware hide the production value limitations in their games compared to the rest of the \"AAA\" industry. If they just go ahead and make a more powerful Switch, I don't know how Nintendo's going to really leverage increasingly generic non-unique hardware in a way that their games don't start looking like they punch below the weight of the hardware they're running on. Sure they need a Switch that can do 1080p/60 and not have background animations running in 3-frame animation loops (looking at you Kirby Forgotten Lands), but if they just make a \"much more powerful Switch 2\" I can't see them really changing the production values of their games At all to match it other than just maintaining high res, stable fps, and not cutting the draw distance in half. And I'm not sure most of Nintendo's market could possibly care less about those details.@uptownsoul \"Standard\" isn't what core gamers want and feel is best. \"Standard\" is whatever the mass market of FIFA/GTA players find acceptable enough for the value price. I agree, right NOW it's a viable alternative. But costs of consoles and games are going up and up, people's discretionary incomes are going down and down, cloud gaming infrastructure is getting better and better and the market for it is getting more and more competitive with bigger and bigger players vying for attention. Eventually it'll just end up that the bulk of the market finds what's there good enough and cheap enough that it's just the default. Eventually you hit a point where all the kids in all the high schools are just used to playing cloud games and that's what they know and don't really see a point in buying a $700+ console to do what they already do a little bit better (and the ones that do won't often have parents that agree), and at that point \"standard\" has been changed. It may at that point not totally obsolete consoles just as Blu-Ray hasn't been obsoleted by Amazon Video, but it's not the standard of what \"most\" people play.Remember when MP3 became the music standard when it still sounded like aluminum? It was cheap and easy even though it was worse. Vinyl still exists for a niche, but it's not the standard. Just how consumer tech goes.@NEStalgia only the core gamers even care enough about streaming/cloud to talk about it...As of now the mass market doesn't care enough about cloud/streaming to see if it's even viable for their home...So again, we're a long, long way away from cloud/streaming being \"the standard\"@NEStalgia yeah, that very thought has crossed my mind. I am not sure what their niche will be post Switch or Switch 2.0 with games having bigger demands. If they don’t play their cards right, the next Gen Nintendo console has WiiU written all over it if it loses 3rd party support.@uptownsoul I think you're underestimating the amount of casual players that are using Game Pass and Luna's streaming products. Game Pass alone had a stat posted here quite a while ago about how 15 or 20% or so of GP users used only touch controls, meaning they played only on phones/tablets. I don't know what Luna's metrics are, but we can be pretty sure that nearly all customers are casual. PS Now was originally intended, largely for the Japan market, to get PS games playable without a PS. IDK what on Earth Sony's streaming strategy is presently, but originally, it was that. The people that will be playing Game Pass built into smart TVs (and the delayed but coming streaming stick) are going to be pretty much all casual. And Tencent is working with Logitech for that streaming handheld (that will fail, but still...)I don't disagree it's not super mainstream yet, but I think you're underestimating the positioning it's at in the market and where that trajectory is building from, including current casual users. That casual market doesn't talk about \"streaming/cloud\" they just know they can play \"that big game\" (AC Valhalla, or whatever) with a $50 controller. They're not worried about the tech that's delivering it or whether it's much better or worse than buying a Series5XS. They just know they're playing the game, it didn't cost much, and it's \"basically like Netflix.\"@rockodoodle One thing we know for sure is Nintendo will never be making games with production values like most of the games industry. It's not what they do or the methodology they do it with. It would never work for them or their financial model. They sit somewhere between indie and AA pretty much always. They could get away with the generational Mario, Zelda, and Metroid Prime on general hardware, but, most of their other output......I adore Kirby Forgotten Lands, but at $60 on a PS5 it would crash and burn hard. And that says nothing of Metroid Dread and the like. Xenoblade is the best JRPG series around short of maybe LoH and Persona, but, I can't see it's current production values approaching more powerful hardware, and I can't see Monolith going all FF with the production values, ever.That's another reason I think \"Switch Pro!\" and \"Switch 2 coming next year\" is a miss. I think they're genuinely worried they're boxed into a corner and when they move on from Switch they're going to be exposed to large cracks forming in their model, so they're going to cling to it as hard as they can. Their games are beloved, among their own customers, but their entire model has revolved around having to make games for a closed system that's 2 generations behind, so it all looks normal, and they haven't had to really advance beyond the industry as it was in 2008. And I don't think they really ever can. We see it crippling even other big publishers as they try to do that. How do they intentionally hold technology back to suit their development staying in the past, while also not just looking obsolete? I think they have to do a Switch 2, but I think they may have to make it have some crazy gimmick to justify it and/or have a short life \"WiiU\" Switch 2, as you said, and move onto a new gimmick after that.Nintendo needs to keep the tech in the past to match their production values and costs. The question is what will they \"add\" to make it exciting? More horsepower won't cut it for their own games. They need the headroom, but stablizing res and fps can't be the draw, their market won't go for that. \"More powerful Switch 2\" seemed obvious...but....it needs to be \"special\"...in a \"nintendo-like-way\" to have its place.@NEStalgia good post. Not sure if this is really the direction Nintendo is headed, but there are rumors that there will be a Switch Lite with 5g connection….they are reportedly spending a ton of money on online play and infrastructure— vague wording in the shareholder financial reports, but it’s in the billions. Are they betting on streaming? Will the 5g Switch Lite be a test of this approach?This way they can keep their quirky hardware and hope that by the time the Switch is ready to sunset, they won’t have to keep up with the hardware ace nearly as much bc the gamer will have steaming options too.@NEStalgia \"15 or 20% or so of GP users used only touch controls\" ...link?But until you provide this link...lets assume your 15 or 20% is true:I don't know how you can say that 15 to 20% using touch controls are casuals when the vast overwhelming % of people signed up to GP are the hardcore...As of now Only the hardcore know and care about GamePass@uptownsoul you are WRONG! there are about 3bn gamers who game 'regularly' yet a 'small' percentage of those play on Console - do the Maths!! 200m+ console gamers vs 3bn gamers.Crossfire has an average of 1bn players, PUBG 1.2bn, Minecraft around 740m players - that's more gamers than Xbox, PS and Switch consoles currently in use right now. Candy Crush makes much more money than Call of Duty!Hardcore gamers aren't really 'console' gamers as the consoles are capped to 30/60fps. They maybe able to run the latest games but with 'compromises' and hardcore gamers won't accept a 30fps cap for 4k visuals. At most, they bridge the gap between the real hardcore gamers and casual gamers by being 'budget' friendly (relatively speaking) for 'dedicated' gamers without the means to invest in a hardcore PC.Its becoming increasingly difficult to build hardware to a budget suitable for the home console market and often lose money on each unit sold - opting to recuperate losses with services (PS+/Gold) and of course running their own 'digital' store so get much more money on EVERY game sold.Game development isn't getting cheaper, as well as distribution costs are constantly rising. Having to port down games to various platforms adds time and cost as well - much easier to make the game you want, not worry about the design and whether it would be suitable for 'weak' hardware, whether its too 'big' to fit on SSD's or Discs etc.Its going to come to a point when Console manufacturers can't make hardware 'cheap' enough and still run the latest games at a significant difference to what they can do with Streaming and couldn't distribute it on Disc anyway because Discs have 'limited' storage. You'd never get MSFS on Console without streaming because the 'size' of the world wouldn't fit on Disc. All that is streaming in as you play. Its not much of a 'leap' to have the game streaming, not just the world data. In fact, that's how you can play on XB1, Mobiles etc...Console gamers are the most vocal 'minority' and there will come a time when the 'majority' are playing via streaming. Its much more sustainable, economical, environmentally better and of course much more accessible to ALL. Servers can be upgraded at anytime to keep up, no waste hardware at the end of their life, no need to make discs, sleeves, cases etc and ship them all over the world, increasing their carbon footprint, the hardware materials are not exactly getting cheaper as 'demand' for electronics in 'everything' is growing etc etc...@uptownsoul I don't have a link for it, it was in an article here sometime in the past 12 months, but I can't find it on a search just looking for \"Game Pass\" and \"touch controls\", I think it was part of an article on GP/Xbox metrics probably from one of the investor reports articles, but I'm not able to locate it quickly. You might be able to hit up Ben or Fraser if you really really need the source, they might remember what article it was in. I was shocked by the metric as well, I definitely didn't expect it.But...similarly where does your claim that \"only the hardcore\" sign up for GP come from? It's a major marketing point for the platform in casual sales, advertising, etc. The fact that some TVs now have GP support built-in suggests the target streaming market is very broad, not just the XSX buyers. \"Try GP for just $1\" promotions suggest they're trying to reel in a very broad sea of people (Phil's 1 billion gamers meme), and not just preaching to the hardcore. Expanding beyond the hardcore, limited console market is a major stated goal of GP.@rockodoodle I don't think Nintendo is going in on streaming with Switch Lite, specifically. I think the 5G model if true is more about downloads and online play from anywhere, not just Wifi hotspots, eg, Monster Hunter, and Splatoon matches from anywhere (OMG I can already foresee the \"connection is unstable\" nightmare looming. Nuuuuuuu!)BUT, I absolutely wouldn't doubt they'd be one of the first to go in on all streaming in the future. They've been playing with it with 3rd party games a lot, and I definitely never saw that coming. It works well in Japan better than anywhere, which is the primary market they're concerned with, and their mobile-first success really makes mobile 5g streaming the core market for them more than any other platform. Of course they're using the Stadia model which is too funny, and sad. Nintendo's version of Game Pass would cost $150 a month run at 540i/20 and exclude \"select titles\" which invariably would mean Splatoon, Kart, Pokemon, and Animal Crossing, lol.I think if they did it, it would still be quirky and \"nintendo-like\", they couldn't risk a generic implementation that more tech-capable companies can just replicate. I think they'd probably try to find a way to make the streaming part of the \"toy\" or gimmick rather than just a delivery mechanism.There's always the rumors of a Nintendo Phone (which honestly would dominate in sales, but they'd need to partner with Apple, Huawei, OnePlus, Samsung, etc for production and I don't see that happening.) It's a hard position for them. They need a portable device that seems \"better\" or \"more unique\" than phones/tablets, that innovates on Switch, without making them change their dev costs/production values. Streaming would work wonders, but I don't think the infrastructure is there for them to depend on streaming 100% yet. But I could see them pioneering there with a \"second pillar.\"I know Furukawa commented that they're cautious about what succeeds Switch, for basically all these reasons, in more corporate-speak. I do think they're kind of worried that following Switch presents big problems. I'm not positive they've even fully finalized what's going to replace it yet (which goes against \"Switch 2, soon\" rumors.)@BAMozzy you wrote an entire book report for what everybody already knew...Sorry, but when I talked about streaming/cloud not being \"the standard\" for a long time...I'm referring to the super demanding games like a GTA6...We all know streaming/cloud can be the standard for Candy Crush, etc right now.@NEStalgia @uptownsoul article link https://www.purexbox.com/news/2021/12/xbox-cloud-gamings-touch-controls-are-more-popular-than-you-might-thinkWhy only PC? Not console at all?@NEStalgia my exact quote was \"the vast overwhelming % of people signed up to GP are the hardcore\"...My source is Xbox themselves when they say GP subscribers spend more than non-subs...If the ratio of hardcore to casuals were the same (in & out of GP)...the spending would be the same in or out of GP@mousieone thank you for the link...20% of Xcloud users are touch screen only...@NEStalgia my bad...I thought you said 20% of GamePass users in general were touch screen only@NEStalgia yeah, I didn’t mean that the Switch Lite was going to be a full streaming play if for no other reason as has been mentioned, the infrastructure just isn’t there yet. But it can be a test the waters of sorts to see if this is the direction they want to move in.@uptownsoul I mean the largest spending in gaming is candy crush, clash of clans, Fortnite, cod, fifa, and gtav. I'm not sure spend is a good outlook of casual vs core. Engagement time probably means more@NEStalgia that's true, but it has nothing to do with streaming/cloud being \"the standard\" any time soon for the increasingly more & more demanding AAA games (GTA6, etc)I love seeing more games joining Xbox and it's important that many of them are Japanese because Xbox One didn't have many.If you have a little bit of patience, you can play most relevant games on Game Pass!I did enjoy this game at first but couldn't get past the intolerable stupidity of the product placement of them big cans. I'd rather the option of paying a fiver to have all that stripped out, that's got to be more than they're making per user from the idiotic sponsorship.

This uniquely-colourful shooter was revealed at Xbox's summer showcase, and it's a console launch exclusive as well! Gamescom Opening Night Live host Geoff Keighley has now confirmed we'll be getting another look at the game this month, woohoo!For now, that's about all we've got to go on. The summer showcase trailer showed a number of short High on Life gameplay clips mashed together, so we're hoping for a more extended demo this time around.We don't have to wait too long to find out if our hopes come true, anyway. Keighley's ONL Showcase goes ahead Tuesday, August 23rd at 11am PT, 2pm ET, and 7pm BST. Here's that Xbox Showcase reveal trailer from back in June:Are you as excited as us about this one hitting Xbox Game Pass on day one? Let us know!About Ben KerryBen is a fan of action, racing and straight-up shootin' in any video game he can get his hands on. When he's not gaming, Ben spends his time listening to way too much Guns N' Roses, watching football and probably eating somewhere.Comments (21)Can't say I'm a fan of rick and morty but this game looks pretty good, like a cross between outer worlds and ratchet and clank.I'm looking forward to it actually.Fingers crossed this is as good as it looked when they announced itGot an odd world strangers wrath and sunset overdrive mashed together had a baby vibe. If it plays really well it could be very good.The trailer for this game was a pleasant surprise at the Xbox show, and really looking forward to it. Don't think I'll dive into any deep dives or anything personally, since I don't have to be evaluating whether I'll buy it or not, just downloading it and playing through it once I have a chance.You have my attention. Refreshing to see the creativity instead of the cookie-cutter, same-ol same-ol games that plague the Triple A space. Extremely refreshing ...One of the showcases I found to be really good. Looking forward to itI just hope I get a plumbus.I've never watched Rick and Morty so can't compare but this game had me with knifey with his stab stabDid they ever say how long it is exclusive to xbox and when it would come to PS and or Switch?@Rmg0731 most likely 3-6 months like other indie games Microsoft get timedI'm too bad at FPSs to be interested in this one. Looks cool tho, but probably not for me.Speaking of GamePass, surprised you guys haven’t done a story yet on Immortals Fenyx Rising coming on 8/30.https://twitter.com/IdleSloth84/status/1559241703676166149?s=20&t=Jx50QwwyRCdUbcPlmmev0wLooks good definitely playing thisI'm still bummed I won't be able to play this in VR like Trover.Heart skipped a beat there for a second as I thought it was another delay story. Really looking forward to this one.Been binge watching Solar opposites lately on Disney + …well worth the watchIt reminds me of Journey to the Savage Planet somewhat.This is at the top of my list. Online co op?@SpacemanJupiter hope so!Haha, I'm all for this!Hopefully we get a date, I don't need to see anymore of it I was sold as soon as I saw the Xbox showcaseThis game just looks like crazy fun. It's that perfect AA insanity and bizarre comedy that doesn't have it's head so far up it's rear end it sees the stars like most AAA games.

It had been rumoured and reported on for months prior as well, following the release of Kojima's PlayStation exclusive Death Stranding.We've seen nothing on the game so far mind; we didn't even get a title when the thing was announced! However, are we about to see this Hideo Kojima Xbox title in action?The famous game maker has taken to Twitter to let us all know that he's \"tentatively finished\" editing something, something that, knowing Kojima's love of extravagant game trailers, could be just that - a new trailer of some sort.This update has also been shared suspiciously close to Gamescom 2022. The upcoming convention takes place August 24-28, with Xbox hosting its own livestream on August 25th. Microsoft hasn't confirmed that any details on the Kojima project will be shared here, but could it be a showcase surprise? We'll continue to hold out hope, for now.Are you looking forward to Kojima's upcoming Xbox game? Let us know what you'd like to see!About Ben KerryBen is a fan of action, racing and straight-up shootin' in any video game he can get his hands on. When he's not gaming, Ben spends his time listening to way too much Guns N' Roses, watching football and probably eating somewhere.Comments (19)I know Kojima means a 'LOT' to some gamers, but I can't think of any Kojima game that I enjoyed and/or really excited to play. I will keep my eye on whatever new information comes and decide whether its something I'm really looking forward to playing, something that might be worth trying as its 'free' on Game Pass, or of no interest at all (like Death Stranding, MGS etc) - same with all 'new' games...Still, it will be interesting to see and hear what Kojima is planning to do - especially if its a Cloud only based game that has been rumoured for quite a while. I'm interested to see and hear how the game utilises the cloud and what that will enable him to do...@BAMozzy same here for me I think he's far too overrated ,some ppl like his games I don't ,maybe this one will b more my taste we shall seeI'll have to agree, but I hope it ends up being a great and monumental game and do for Xbox what Death Stranding did for the PS4.I'm an absolute Stan for Kojima. Wherever Kojima goes, I'll be there to play it.Yeah I'm with the above users. Never really understood the acclaim. His stuff is different, which should always be appreciated, but for me, I don't really see the buzz.@SplooshDmg Me too.I'm more upset that kojima couldnt be bothered with a mgs4 port, so now we're stuck with never seeing it outside of the ps3 or streaming. Unless...Whatever it is it'll probably have a bad storyThere's always something special in his games even those with flaws. With death stranding it was the interesting courier mechanics, narrative and soundtracks that really appealed to me. If I understand correctly he is planning for this to be a streamed game? Would that allow for devices to play more computationally heavy games maybe? (Not an expert)He’s one of the most imaginative and creative devs producing AAA consoles games today. They’re rarely perfect 10/10…but I’d say they’ve all been memorable and stick with anyone that plays them.I’m really looking forward to seeing what he can do with the cloud. I’m hoping it will be a chapter based horror game that will use your location some how (local news or something) and really add to a sense of familiarity in a dark twisted environment. I’m sure whatever it is the trailer will be decent anyways.I really want to hear more from team ninjas horror too…that’s been way too quiet.@CynicalGamer Not necessarily streamed, but it will utilize cloud tech. Example, a game like Sea of Thieves uses Microsoft cloud servers to calculate complicated shared wave physics, or Flight Simulator that is millions of GBs of data stored on a server and streamed to a console or PC progressively while in flight. Essentially, the cloud can offer extra resources to local hardware that otherwise just aren't there, which does enable designers to do things that were not possible before.I thought it was apparent this cloud game is still very early on in development@SplooshDmg sounds interesting. ThanksI’ve never been the biggest Kojima fan, I like his games, but I never understood the obsession over him. With that said, after a long time of making fun of Death Stranding, I decided to give it a try and I loved it, it was truly a unique game. I’m more interested in his work now than I have been in the past, though I’m still not clamoring for his next game.@Odium I still vividly remember MGS4 as one of the best games I have ever played. It is true that DS was not exactly everyone's cup of tea. But he is probably one of the last video game authors/directors with full creative control and vision on how to make his games (as absurd as they may be). In an age of designed-by-board-of-directors products across all forms of entertainment, he is something to be cherished.One of the last true visionaries left in this buisness, he still has the influence to design and build a game without pandering to the marketting teams of big corps.Whilst his appeal is certainly not universal, and his designs are sometimes willfully obscure, Konima's projects should be celebrated as an anthesis of the 'cookie cutter' 'design by committe' titles so often green lighted by boardrooms chasi g profits over creativity.Based on previous experiences, I expect theres only a 30% chance of me loving a new Kojima game. But theres a 100% chance I will find it interesting and worthy of thought, and I think our industry would be far healthier if we had several such designers able to pursue pure concepts.@BAMozzy that's a \"you\" problemIf you turned Keanu Reeves Japanese you'd get Hideo Kojima.@BrilliantBill if there’s one thing I’ve always given him credit for and admired him for it was his ability to innovate. I’m 37 and have been gaming most of my life, to this day, I still can’t think of a boss battle that blew my mind more than Psychomantis. I struggle to think of a moment outside of X-Men on SEGA Genesis that had a moment where you had to rush to hit and hold the reset button or you got game over, that had such a unique in game mechanic. I’ve just usually struggled with his stories and his balancing of weird and real world. It’s his style, so I respect that, I’m certainly not one to tell Kojima to do something different, I just don’t always feel that the weird characters and story moments he throws into his games always work, at least not for me. Don’t get me wrong, I do respect him and usually like his games, I’m just nit head over heels like most people seem to be. I’m more of a, “wait for reviews” kind of guy with him, rather than, “it’s Kojima, I’m getting it.” Tap here to load 19 commentsLeave A CommentHold on there, you need to login to post a comment...Two More Games Added To September 2022's Xbox Game Pass LineupAlong with news of a delaySome Notable Titles Are Leaving Xbox Game Pass This Month (August 31)10 in totalNew Lord Of The Rings Game Announced By 2K Publisher Private DivisionExpected to launch 2023-24Xbox Game Pass Is Hurting Right Now, But Larger Forces Are At PlayAll we need, is just a little patienceFour Games Are Confirmed For Xbox Game Pass In September 2022 So FarUpdate: Make that five! 31Pick One What's The Best Racing Series In Xbox History? 9Video Here's A Look At Xbox 360 Emulation On The Steam Deck 14Talking Point What September 2022 Xbox Games With Gold Do You Want? 8News Who's Your Daddy?!

The company is introducing an early access period specifically for the game's campaign mode, however, there's a slight catch.First off, this is exclusive to pre-orders, which makes sense given the nature of the bonus. However, it's also exclusive to digital pre-orders, meaning folks who opt for the physical version have no early access option for campaign.Thankfully, there's no platform bias here as is the case with the upcoming multiplayer beta. While the online beta has an exclusive period just for PlayStation users, campaign early access is the same across all platforms: one week early for digital pre-orders.To be honest, we're okay with this in general! While we'd like the deal to reach physical versions as well, it is purely the story campaign, so there's no pre-release multiplayer advantage to be gained through early access. The full game is set to launch on Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S on October 28th.Does this sweeten the deal enough for a pre-order? Let us know in the comments!About Ben KerryBen is a fan of action, racing and straight-up shootin' in any video game he can get his hands on. When he's not gaming, Ben spends his time listening to way too much Guns N' Roses, watching football and probably eating somewhere.Comments (6)Oof, a significant blow for physical media!Well at least someone on here can give us an honest opinion of the campaign before full release ☀️@Olliemar28 Yep, pain.I always only ever play the campaign element of Call of Duty, and as much as I want to play this game, this is the first time that I might not actually pre-order the game, which is typical considering that they are actually giving early access to the only component that holds any interest for me.The reason that I'm not going to buy it this time round (or at least probably not, as I am pretty weak-willed when it comes down to it) is that I think this game will be one of the earliest entries on to the Game Pass once the acquisition goes through as adding this title will really make a splash.Having said all that, knowing me, I will struggle to contain myself, and I'll end up buying it either in a sale, or worse still, pre-ordering it.So weak-willed... @Fiendish-Beaver I don't think they'll be able to add any of the recent cod's to gamepass until after Sony's marketing deal is finished they could always put mw2 remastered on gamepass & update it to add the multiplayer thoughHmmm, you maybe right, @Would_you_kindly, however, the only thing that may count against that is that Sony were completely blindsided by the AB acquisition, and so it is probably unlikely that they have blocked its inclusion on to Game Pass as they just didn't think it likely to happen. I mean, why pay to block something appearing on Game Pass that you never expect to arrive there anyway?Having said that, you have now sowed a seed of doubt in my mind, and I can feel my will weakening still further....

Well, it seems the Activision-owned studio is now cooking something else up.The developer recently took to Twitter to show off its 'Wall of Games', a huge plaque commemorating all the stuff Toys For Bob has worked on over the years. Curiously, the team has a conveniently-placed slot for an upcoming title.Now, this could be anything, but the fact that the developer is teasing any sort of upcoming game has taken us by surprise. Last year, the team confirmed its involvement in Call of Duty development, specifically the free-to-play Warzone. Given Activision's continued support for CoD, many of us assumed the developer was no longer working on any other IP.Well, it seems the team is working on something else! Let's hope their upcoming game is either Spyro, Crash, or something completely new.What would you like to see Toys For Bob work on? Let us know in the comments!About Ben KerryBen is a fan of action, racing and straight-up shootin' in any video game he can get his hands on. When he's not gaming, Ben spends his time listening to way too much Guns N' Roses, watching football and probably eating somewhere.Comments (16)Half-Life 3 confirmedBanjo-Kazooie project with Rare and Playtonic 😁.Many would argue against it, but I wouldn't scoff at a Crash/Spyro crossover, possibly using the Skylanders lore as a bridge to connect the two stories together.The reported difficulty spikes in CB4 put me right off. Let's hope it's not another Souls like platformer :/I hope it's Spyro. Crash 4 is amazing, and they've done great work on the Spyro remasters, they deserve to take the franchise over.@ymo1965 try it for yourself. It's tough, but nowhere near Soulslike. There's a casual mode that I wish all difficult games used that helps you if you die too much without actually making the gameplay any easier. It's a great game.I hope its not a Crash or Jak game.102 Dalmatians rules. That mini golf mini game. 🙏@OliverOwen Jak is a sony IPClearly it’s a new Madagascar title.Memes aside, I’d just hope it’s Crash, Spyro, or Tony Hawk. I loved all the recent titles from those franchises and want to keep seeing them release.@DeathByLasagna Vicarious Visions should go back to Tony Hawk games.Star Control 2+I hope it’s something Spyro related. I’m fine if it’s another Crash Bandicoot title, but I would be even more excited if it was a new Spyro game. Toys for Bob did an outstanding job remastering the original 3 Spyro games, and I would love to see them take on a potential Spyro 4 that takes place after Year of the Dragon. Another Crash game would still be exciting, though.Love crash & spyro would love a new spyro game that's more like the og trilogy also would like a remake of crash tag team racing & twinsanityHopefully post Kotick they can make games again. Crash 4 didn't sell well, but it seems partially due to the terrible PC DRM. I think they could do better next time, it'd be a shame for them to be reduced to nothing but CoD support.\"New Crash? I wonder where you got that information from? I wasn't supposed to leak that.\"\"I think we could see a new Crash Bandicoot, and not only is it gonna be a new Crash Bandicoot, it's gonna be a multiplayer Crash Bandicoot... It's like a four-player brawler almost, but Crash oriented.\"Jez Corden Tap here to load 16 commentsLeave A CommentHold on there, you need to login to post a comment...Some Notable Titles Are Leaving Xbox Game Pass This Month (August 31)10 in totalTwo More Games Added To September 2022's Xbox Game Pass LineupAlong with news of a delayNew Lord Of The Rings Game Announced By 2K Publisher Private DivisionExpected to launch 2023-24Xbox Game Pass Is Hurting Right Now, But Larger Forces Are At PlayAll we need, is just a little patienceFour Games Are Confirmed For Xbox Game Pass In September 2022 So FarUpdate: Make that five!Game ProfileTitle:Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About TimeSystem:Xbox Series X|SAlso Available For:PS5, Switch, PS4Publisher:ActivisionDeveloper:Toys for BobGenre:PlatformerRelease Date:Xbox OneReviews:Review: Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time - Platforming Bliss On Xbox Series XWhere to buy:Buy on Amazon \n",

At this stage, such a move doesn't come as much of a surprise (seriously, everything is being delayed), however, thankfully it's still set to launch this year.Evil West's release date has shifted a few months, from September 20th to November 22nd. This will allow developer Flying Wild Hog to \"deliver the best experience\" for players at launch.The last time we saw the game in action, we were pretty damn impressed. Evil West looks like an incredibly fun and frantic FPS, marrying its classic Wild West theme with some over-the-top monsters and weaponry. It looks a hell of a good time.Will you be picking Evil West up later this year?

The folks there could do with a rest.This one looks really good.2 month delay isn't so bad. A lot of games will rest easy in November with Hogwarts Legacy out the way.

Nice. I played the demo and it's pretty excellent.Definitely excited for Immortal Fenyx Rising.Three great looking Day One games: Immorality, Tinykin and Midnight Flight Express. And good mix of other games. Make sure you check out Opus.Tinykin and Immortals Fenyx Rising are great additions!Coffee Talk was a surprise, so I gave it a go this morning and picked up all the three achievements for the weekly streak in five minutes! Another game that appears to have been review bombed by idiots.That's a good-looking line-up of games....Immortals fenix rising is rubbish. One of the worst open world games Ive played. Looking forward to Commandos 3 and Midnight express though!@Clankylad Coffee Talk is fantastic. It’s the perfect visual novel for people that don’t quite like visual novels. Really relaxing game.Might give tinykin a try, the rest don't interest me thoughMidnight Fight Express and Immortality have my interest. TMNT Cowabunga Collection will have my time the end of the month, however.Immortals Fenyx Rising is probably my game of this generation thus far (and that includes Elden Ring). Absolutely loved the game. Cannot recommend it enough...The Xbox post hints at more surprise games coming this week, any idea what those might be?Kinda a great batch, IMO. Lots of variety and, in the case of Fenyx Rising, a game I had wanted to play but got washed away by other releases.Fenyx Rising is really fun. Great atmosphere, fun combat, some decent puzzles. Well worth a play.My one criticism is that there are TOO many puzzles in the game. Everything you want to do or collect is gated behind a puzzle, which is fine. But by the end of the game the player is really sick of pushing boulders onto switches over and over.But that is a minor gripe. It is well worth your time, especially if you have gamepass.Immortals ftwDefinitely playing Midnight Fight Express and Immortals Fenyx Rising@funkhouser QuakeCon is this week so maybe thatImmortals fenyx rising feels and plays like a zelda botw-lite, which isnt a bad thing. The humor is subjective. I enjoyed it. Looking forward to midnight fight express. Getting some oldschool beat'em up vibes from it.@Solidchief Oh man. I could really go for Quake II Remastered.@Solidchief That's true! Can't wait to find out what they have in store!@SplooshDmg Same, it's the 25 anniversary of Quake II so there's a chance we could get a remastered version.Glad I didn’t get Immortals Fenyx Rising, now I can continue ignoring on game pass.definetly a good batch of game i am excited about since a long time they finaly heard us 😊👌👍❤️dang it, i own immortals fenyx rising too. ah well, at least i don't have to worry about it being taken off gamepass this wayCoffee Talk used to be on GP and left didn't it? Could have sworn I played it a bit before....@funkhouser Hopefully Goldeneye!Thats a pretty sweet collection of games.

In a world where the use of powerful alchemy was once widespread and welcomed, things have gone terribly wrong. The now blood-soaked streets are filled with plague-ridden monstrosities and it's up to you, Corvus, to take out the mutated trash.OverBorder Studios' Thymesia is the latest in a long line of Soulslike experiences that attempts to capture FromSoftware's magic whilst adding a few of its own twists and gameplay wrinkles for good measure. As is de rigueur with the genre, we've got the same basic ground rules as usual at work here. Bonfires, now known as beacons, dot the landscape and provide a chance to rest and increase your stats whilst also regenerating all nearby enemies. Death sees you leave behind your collected memories, giving you one chance to return to collect them, and there's a central nexus, here known as Pilgrimage Hill, that you can return to when you want to wallow in the game's brooding atmosphere or have a disappointingly short chat with the one NPC who resides there.Yes, if you've played any Soulslike over the past few years, you already know the general gist of how things play out in Thymesia, but this is a game that has managed to garner some extra attention in the run-up to its release because, well, it looks the business. There's a nice art-style at work here, Corvus is a fast and flashy protagonist, and at first glance the haunted forests and bloodstained streets that you claw and slash your way through give off a little bit of a Bloodborne vibe which, let's face it, is a vibe well worth giving off.Further to this, the game's combat has got enough fresh ideas to warrant investigation. Corvus attacks foes with a combination of fast saber slashes and a slower, heavier claw attack. The general idea is that enemy health bars have got two elements that you need to work on destroying. Slash at them with your saber and you'll see the white bar turn green, indicating that you're inflicting wound damage. The white will regenerate and reclaim all of the exposed green area unless you then strike out with your claw, permanently removing the green portion and doing actual lasting damage on top of temporary wounds. Whittle the bar down to zero and your enemy will be opened up for a finishing move that's indicated by a glowing red spot robbed right out of Sekiro.It's a system that encourages you to keep on the front foot, getting stuck into enemies with combos - there is no stamina to worry about here - in order to stop their wounds regenerating. On top of this, Thymesia introduces a neat plague weapons mechanic that sees you steal whatever weapon skill your current enemy is in possession of by charging up your claw attack and then unleashing it, sending Corvus driving forward to pluck the essence of their weapon from them for a one time use.The plague weapons on offer give you plenty of options to play with, there's a total of 21 to collect, and they cover great big hammers, whips, swords, axes, scythes and more exotic blood-leeching fare, that afford you the opportunity to strategize somewhat as you blast through levels, collecting up memory shards to beef up your stats and skills with an eye on the boss that lurks at the end of every area. After a time you'll also unlock plague weapons permanently in your inventory, giving you the opportunity to set them to a second slot and affording Corvus a mix of permanent and one-time use plague weapons to play with. As you claw at foes you'll receive random drops of weapon-specific upgrade points which can then be used to strengthen the attack stats of your collection. Use your claw to attack a hammer-wielding foe and they'll drop hammer upgrades, sword foes drop sword upgrades and so on.With regards to upgrading Corvus' core stats, you only need worry about pumping your memory shards into strength, vitality and plague attributes and each level that you gain rewards you with a talent point to use in the game's talent skill tree. It's here that you can freely unlock and then reset various skills at your convenience in order to build a Corvus that suits your playstyle best. You may want to pump all your points into your saber, for example, ensuring it gives you lots of energy back as you attack - energy is what you'll need to pull off plague weapon attacks after all - and there's also upgrades for your claw, dodge, deflection skills, feather darts, and more general stuff like buffs to your attacks when your health falls under a certain level.The core combat system here really is pretty solid and unique stuff, at least on paper. However, you may have noticed us mention feather darts, dodges and deflections in that last paragraph, and this is where things begin to fall apart somewhat. Thymesia has got far too many systems in play for its own good, some of which feel utterly pointless and most of which feel like they need some refinement and adjustment with regards to how annoyingly tight their windows of opportunity are.Take the game's feather darts as an example, these are used to stagger an enemy's charged attacks and delay wound regeneration, and are deployed with a quick press of the left trigger. After being introduced to this mechanic in the tutorial we completely forgot about it, it just feels unnecessary, does very little damage - at least until you level it up - and simply dodging out of the way of charged attacks and then moving in for some saber and claw strikes feels like much the better option.This same issue extends to the game's deflection system. Time your block with the left shoulder button and you'll deflect an enemy's attack. Fair enough. But the rewards for doing this aren't worth how difficult it is to master the extremely tight and tricky timing - there's no opening up the enemy for a fancy riposte here - and so you're much better off simply dodging out of the way. However, even dodging has its issues, it feels unrefined, and for the most part we chose to hammer the dodge button rather than trying to get into a rhythm of perfect escapes.It all results in combat that feels rather baggy on the defence side of things, never reaching a place where it makes the player feel like they're in total control, weaving in and out of enemy attacks and delivering ripostes when the opportunity arises. In short, on offense Thymesia feels fine for the most part, but outside of this it's a messy bag of mechanics that could, and should, have been streamlined. Take out the feathers and the deflection and just give us plague weapons, saber/claw attacks and a dodge and this may have felt much slicker overall.Outside of combat and, well, you have to take Thymesia's indie nature and budget price point into consideration here. There are just three distinct areas in the game, with a small hub and a final small boss region to bulk things out a tad. Not too much in the way of variety all in all. You'll run through an area once and face off against its boss, then you'll be offered a series of sub-quests that see you return to a slightly different version of that same area to collect something or battle a secondary boss. This amounts to a lot of backtracking and repetition in both scenery and enemy types and it's an issue that's exacerbated early on by a first major boss we needed to grind for a good few hours in order to beat. Yes, Thymesia's first big challenge is a bit of a badly balanced nightmare and we ended up running through the very first area of the game countless times over in order to eventually best him through brute force. Not an ideal start.What's more, once we finally defeated this first big bad, we found ourselves feeling entirely over-levelled for the rest of our adventure. Run-of-the-mill enemies who'd presented a challenge could now be brushed aside, we relied a lot less on plague weapons as simply slashing and clawing easily dispatched most foes, and the energy, immediacy and atmosphere of the game mostly disappeared as we blasted through the rest of the campaign with little trouble outside of boss battles.In terms of these bosses, that very tricky first battle laid bare most of the issues we had with deflecting, dodging and firing off feathers, but then subsequent bosses felt almost too easy, with most of them falling on our second or third attempt. There are some highlights, a face-off against the ferociously fast Urd, and a rather unique God of the Fools battle that requires some platforming, but overall this is a game that feels as though it's lacking balance. It's also a game that fails to deliver on the lore front, there's very little going on story-wise, and level design is also pedestrian stuff involving lots of bland corridors and small areas that very often feel ill-suited to the battles at hand.With a little more polish and refinement in terms of its combat mechanics, more surprises in level layout and more balance with regards to difficulty across the board, Thymesia could well have been a solid indie Soulslike surprise. The essentials are absolutely there, however it just feels too messy, too short and too imbalanced to earn a really solid recommendation this time around. If you're a huge fan of the Soulslike genre this one may still scratch that itch, but overall it's an experience that ended up frustrating us more than anything else.Thymesia has all the ingredients necessary to make for a solid indie Soulslike experience, but it falls short due to messy implementation of mechanics, bland level design, weak lore and issues with difficulty balancing. There are some really neat ideas here, for sure, with the game's plague weapons providing lots of variety in how you go about dealing with your enemies, but unnecessary and awkward elements such as an overly tricky deflection system and dodge mechanics that need tightening up sully the overall combat experience. With a little more TLC this could have been a banger, but as things stand it's a fairly average effort that's hard to recommend if you're not a huge fan of the genre.Not Bad 6/10Scoring PolicyComments (8)If its on Gamepass I'll play it.Shame, I had high hopes for this. Oh well, just gives me more time on Cult of the lamb!Solid 20 dollar romp probably. I’ll cop on sale@Dusk_Actual Yeah, for the right price i think it's prob still worth a look if you're into the genre.@Nightcrawler71 where are you enjoying cult of the lamb? Switch, xbox, steam deck? And how is it, from the management sim side, to the action-y bits.@PhhhCough I bought it on Xbox Series X in the end. It’s has a great gameplay loop, from going on runs (or “crusades” as they are called here) to managing your cult. Lots of things to unlock. It wasn’t even on my radar a week ago, now it’s my go-to game!Nope Hermes don't deliver any moreThe moment you said Soulslike experience it became a pass for me.

Hosted by 44 Bytes.Roundup: Here's What The Critics Think Of Next-Gen RPG ThymesiaGuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpIt's thymeNext-gen Soulslike Thymesia is finally out in the wild, after a fair bit of hype building since the game's initial reveal. Well, the reviews are in, including our own PX take, ahead of public release on Thursday, August 18th.Without further ado, here's what the critics are saying about Thymesia so far:Thymesia has all the ingredients necessary to make for a solid indie Soulslike experience, but it falls short due to messy implementation of mechanics, bland level design, weak lore and issues with difficulty balancing. There are some really neat ideas here, for sure, with the game's plague weapons providing lots of variety in how you go about dealing with your enemies, but unnecessary and awkward elements such as an overly tricky deflection system and dodge mechanics that need tightening up sully the overall combat experience. With a little more TLC this could have been a banger, but as things stand it's a fairly average effort that's hard to recommend if you're not a huge fan of the genre.Still, at 10 hours, Thymesia is short enough that it doesn't overstay its welcome. You wind up feeling more like a general badass than a vastly overpowered killing machine for the most part, and the game's great ideas culminate in some intense, memorable boss fights. While a few elements of the overall experience don't gel, Thymesia understands what matters most about its inspirations, while adding a few spins of its own to create a small, smart, and rewarding Souls-like experience.Thymesia is a confident, good-looking Soulslike that arguably ranks among the best of the non-From Software titles in the genre, but it’s let down by a few issues. The world is fun enough to explore, but a lack of proper narrative and real context harms the atmosphere. Combat, though, is exceptionally good when it works, and it works most of the time. It takes a little patience on the player’s part, but so do all games in this genre. Fans seeking that Soulslike rush will find a lot to like here, though, and it feels different enough to the usual crop to stand out and hold your attention.By now we’re definitely starting to feel the effects of genre fatigue amongst soulslikes. And Thymesia certainly reaches a point where it can’t separate itself from the games that came before. However, there is still a lot of originality in its combat systems and world design so that the game doesn’t feel too derivative. It’s just a shame that clunky controls and awkward bugs hold it back.Thymesia isn’t shy about its influences, an admittance that helps and harms the title when inevitably compared to its legendary brethren. But any Soulslike fan who is willing to look past the budgetary shortcomings will find this modest monster masher a fine way to spend a gloomy weekend. While Thymesia is certainly lacking in some key departments, the solid control, satisfying combat, moody atmosphere, and compelling challenge are still well worth crowing about.You can see the make-up of a good game at the heart of Thymesia, but it seems the team was only capable of delivering a prototype; the building blocks of something greater, before it tapped out. You can easily spend ten-ish hours with the game, and potentially longer if you decide to experiment with builds, but at $25 (or $22.49 with the launch week discount), it might be a hard sell.Thymesia certainly isn’t the worst indie Souls-like money can buy. Especially for its reasonable price point, players get a handful of really fun and challenging boss battles, but I wish the levels in between didn’t come across as filler. Thymesia ends up feeling like Bloodborne’s younger, less-gifted cousin — he may not be all that great, but he still has some redeeming qualities.Thymesiais a shadow. It’s a word which doesn’t just describe its raven-like plague-masked protagonist Corvus, but its beholden nature to the many Soulsborne games which have come before it. It functions, moves, sounds, and reads like those titles in myriad ways, but absent of their artistic detail, careful environmental storytelling, or meaningful depth. What’s left is a bare outline, a third-person action RPG with a minimal skill tree, a slew of broken mechanics, a paltry roster of enemies, and some atrocious boss fights.A bit of a mixed bag then, although generally, reviews are more positive than negative. Our own 6/10 scoring falls close to the MetaCritic average, currently sitting at 69 for Xbox Series X|S at the time of writing. Not too bad then, all things considered!Will you be picking up Thymesia?

PS+ or when it comes on 'sale' either)Soul Hackers 2 is out in a little over a week. Diofield Chronicles got a demo out last week. Why do we have two headline stories covering a 6/10 reviewed indie nobody's even heard of when there's two reasonably significant Sega/Squeenix titles being almost entirely ignored on PXB? They're not PlayStation exclusives, but you'd think they are if you visit these sites.... I've been looking forward to this for the best part of a year now, and almost bought it yesterday (it had not been available to purchase until then), however, caution got the better of me, and I decided to wait for the reviews to drop. Now I'm glad that I didn't buy it, and I will await user reviews to see whether it gets more favourable reviews. Ultimately, I hope that it ends up on Game Pass, as that would most likely suit be best as is. Very disappointed to see it reviewing so lowly, though...Don't think I will bother...haven't even finished Elden Ring....even though I was really enjoying it I don't think I will ever go back...after you leave a game for a while it's hard to go back...got a few games I need to finish that I can't motivate myself too Tap here to load 4 commentsLeave A CommentHold on there, you need to login to post a comment...Two More Games Added To September 2022's Xbox Game Pass LineupAlong with news of a delaySome Notable Titles Are Leaving Xbox Game Pass This Month (August 31)10 in totalNew Lord Of The Rings Game Announced By 2K Publisher Private DivisionExpected to launch 2023-24Xbox Game Pass Is Hurting Right Now, But Larger Forces Are At PlayAll we need, is just a little patienceFour Games Are Confirmed For Xbox Game Pass In September 2022 So FarUpdate: Make that five!Game ProfileTitle:ThymesiaSystem:Xbox Series X|SAlso Available For:PS5Publisher:Team17Developer:OverBorder StudioGenre:Action, RPGRelease Date:Xbox Series X|SReviews:Review: Thymesia - Sadly, This Soulslike RPG Isn't As Great As It LooksWhere to buy:Buy on Amazon \n",

Nice. I played the demo and it's pretty excellent.Definitely excited for Immortal Fenyx Rising.Three great looking Day One games: Immorality, Tinykin and Midnight Flight Express. And good mix of other games. Make sure you check out Opus.Tinykin and Immortals Fenyx Rising are great additions!Coffee Talk was a surprise, so I gave it a go this morning and picked up all the three achievements for the weekly streak in five minutes! Another game that appears to have been review bombed by idiots.That's a good-looking line-up of games....Immortals fenix rising is rubbish. One of the worst open world games Ive played. Looking forward to Commandos 3 and Midnight express though!@Clankylad Coffee Talk is fantastic. It’s the perfect visual novel for people that don’t quite like visual novels. Really relaxing game.Might give tinykin a try, the rest don't interest me thoughMidnight Fight Express and Immortality have my interest. TMNT Cowabunga Collection will have my time the end of the month, however.Immortals Fenyx Rising is probably my game of this generation thus far (and that includes Elden Ring). Absolutely loved the game. Cannot recommend it enough...The Xbox post hints at more surprise games coming this week, any idea what those might be?Kinda a great batch, IMO. Lots of variety and, in the case of Fenyx Rising, a game I had wanted to play but got washed away by other releases.Fenyx Rising is really fun. Great atmosphere, fun combat, some decent puzzles. Well worth a play.My one criticism is that there are TOO many puzzles in the game. Everything you want to do or collect is gated behind a puzzle, which is fine. But by the end of the game the player is really sick of pushing boulders onto switches over and over.But that is a minor gripe. It is well worth your time, especially if you have gamepass.Immortals ftwDefinitely playing Midnight Fight Express and Immortals Fenyx Rising@funkhouser QuakeCon is this week so maybe thatImmortals fenyx rising feels and plays like a zelda botw-lite, which isnt a bad thing. The humor is subjective. I enjoyed it. Looking forward to midnight fight express. Getting some oldschool beat'em up vibes from it.@Solidchief Oh man. I could really go for Quake II Remastered.@Solidchief That's true! Can't wait to find out what they have in store!@SplooshDmg Same, it's the 25 anniversary of Quake II so there's a chance we could get a remastered version.Glad I didn’t get Immortals Fenyx Rising, now I can continue ignoring on game pass.definetly a good batch of game i am excited about since a long time they finaly heard us 😊👌👍❤️dang it, i own immortals fenyx rising too. ah well, at least i don't have to worry about it being taken off gamepass this wayCoffee Talk used to be on GP and left didn't it? Could have sworn I played it a bit before....@funkhouser Hopefully Goldeneye!Thats a pretty sweet collection of games.

Hosted by 44 Bytes.Grounded Is Receiving Major New 'Shared Worlds' FeatureGuestLogin or Sign UpGuestLogin or Sign UpCommunal gardensDeveloper Obsidian has announced that it's testing a major new Grounded feature right now. 'Shared Worlds' are being worked on for the studio's garden survival sim, with a wider release expected soon.In short, Shared Worlds provide the option to save your server in the cloud for friends to then download and play on, even when the creator is offline. Think of it like a persistent world that exists even when you log off! Here are the team's patch notes for the feature, currently in testing:You can now create a Shared World as well as the Standard Worlds you have been doing since Game Preview launch. Shared Worlds are stored in the cloud and you can share them with any of your friends so they can host that world while you are not online.-You can own up to three Shared Worlds at any given time.\n",
      "-You can have 50 worlds shared with you at any given time.\n",
      "-Any Standard Worlds from before can be converted to a Shared World via the Save / Load menu.\n",
      "-Any Shared World you own or have been shared with can be copied down as a local Standard World for you to play on your own.\n",
      "-Shared Worlds can only be played by hosting it as a Multiplayer game.\n",
      "-Only one person can host a Shared World at a time (others will be able to join the current player who is hosting).\n",
      "-Any game progress that happens while anyone is hosting a Shared World will be properly restored regardless of who hosts the world next.-Owner of Shared World who is hosting can logout for the day and have someone else who has the world shared with them re-host it while they are offline.\n",
      "-You can use this system to share copies of save games with friends: Create a Shared copy of an existing world, share it with said friend, have them download a Standard copy of it on their end.\n",
      "-If you own both a Steam copy and an Xbox / Windows Store copy, you can use this system to have a single Shared world that you can play through across all platforms.NOTE: This feature is considered beta and could have issues and could require online shared saves to be reset / lost as bugs are ironed out. If you test this feature out with a save with lots of progress, make sure it is not the only working copy of the world you have on your account. The shared save service could also go offline at any time during this testing phase to account for issues or updates as needed.Does this sound like a good feature for Grounded?

Minecraft should have implemented this ages ago.Awesome. I've been wanting something like this for a long time. I didn't like having the world forever linked to the host. I wanted my friends to be able to build the base while I was away and vise versa. Grounded is a very good game.Super excited for the release. Shared worlds is going to definitely help bring some of my friends over. Can see really could implantation and really crazy worlds in the future.So it's like when we would build a clubhouse at my grandma's when I was a kid, and then I'd go back a few days later to see my cousins had gone over and f*** it all up.Can't wait to relive those memories!
